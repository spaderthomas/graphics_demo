Boon has to go to get his first augmentation. This would involve going to see the doctor, getting an explanation on augmentations, and then choosing which one you want to start with. the problem with this is that it's very anti in media res, which i like a lot. maybe the main city isn't the FSF base, but is instead a foreign city where you have to figure out the vibe, who to trust, factions -- so you never exactly feel at home. vampire. 
maybe instead boon has to seek out a black market doctor. like the asian doctor from blade runner. someone who's doing some fucked up stuff. but for a not altogether bad cause -- he's opposing the regime, and he's helping you, maybe even kicking back some of his services pro bono to charity. everyone's after him. you can go to the underground and drop off your kid with leukemia and they got a 50/50 chance of coming back three weeks later -- not that his success rate isn't immaculate, but the fact of the matter is the dude is hard to get a hold of. and there are rumors that, well, every business has to source materials from somewhere. it's not possible to purely synthesize all the human parts you need. 
anyway, the FSF smuggled one of their guys into the city because this dude is the only one that can save him. boon's gotta track him down. he only has rumors really -- there are a few connections in the city that can probably lead him closer to where he wants to go, but nothing definite. 
one: super low key tech dude. he's hooked into the routers behind all the traffic that heads into the city. he's used it to build a network of people, who they know, who they talk to. all the messages themselves are encrypted, but just the metadata is worth its weight in gold. he works a bit for both sides. use him at your peril. he doesn't deal in commodities, so he prefers favors. maintaining his hold over the network traffic is hard. he has no muscle of his own. if you want him to help you track down the doc, you gotta go in and kill one of the maintenence guys at the data center where the router is. he's got most of them under his thumb, but a new guy is thinking of snitching. take care of him.

demon's souls setup: one main hub, and then when you go do a mission it's just the 'dungeon'. this could take a number of different forms. you could have an actual dungeon that you go through, maybe solving puzzles and fighting minibosses (no random encounters!). you could have something that's really just a series of battles. the main hub will be much richer than in demon's souls -- less of a jumping off point and more of the jumping off point of the action.
