@spader 3/27/19: A way to parse in TDS files without adding them to the global
scope. One problem with this is that often nodes refer to keys that exist in the
global scope, so you would have to check there to know where they are e.g.
#+BEGIN_SRC 
# foo.tds
default_foo = "bums"

# bar.tds
whatevz = {
    sup = "spum"
    foo = default_foo
}
#+END_SRC

@spader 3/27/19: A way to write out a TDS table without overwriting the whole
file. As in, find where the KVP for the table is, kill exactly that part of the
file and overwrite it. Doesn't sound too hard. 
* Done!
@spader 3/26/19: Auto grid snapping isn't complete. It requires you to press ESC
to un-select a tile, because that's its cue to restore the old grid snapping
state. Need to be able to do that if you just select something in the script
selector. @done 3/27/19
@spader 3/26/19: Load tiles into levels. Everything's there, this should be real
easy. @done 3/27/19
