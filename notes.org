** quests
*** domestic dispute
a total happenstance sidequest that begins with you in an empty room, and if you
venture to the right place you can hear something interesting through the wall
-- maybe even a litle knocking/bumping animation around the correct spot, or a
tiny hum that gets louder the closer you get.
*** chickenshit larry
chickenshit larry is the guard you meet in the twisted realm in the first
interlude. he's hiding in a broom closet, because the twisted realm is just so
twisted. if you kill him, that's it. he's done. you get a nice item in
compensation. if you let him go, he's there for you later on in the sixth
grade. maybe he gives you a heal, or some buffs, or an even better item, or
assists in for a few rounds.

larry also has friends in the hub. he was a vet of the korean war. didn't die
there -- hell, the most action he got was on shore leave in seoul with some
_kijichon_. 
** details
a man who has nailed himself to the cross like christ, flayed his own skin raw
because he believes himself to be in the christian version of hell. he can get
down whenever he wants. 

souls swarthily introducing themselves by name, date of death, manner of death. 
"hi, name's ted swanson. nineteen fifty three, wrapped my station wagon around a
telephone pole -- dad was such a mean drunk, and school was the only place i
ever felt /safe/. and you?"

"uncle rufus, were you worried about me??"
"well of course not, young oliver. you know as well as i do that we souls lack
hormonal and nervous systems in our body. i'm as cold and unfeeling as you are,
my boy!"

it has to have special sounds that play along with each character of the text,
different for different characters. 

text that fades in for a new area (ni no kuni, the witness)

musical themes for players. barbara ann. 

menu: you want it to squirt open or i'm not sure the right word for it. the
really satisfying animation where you tab onto something, it hangs for a second,
and then it expands. the menu should be really clear. one of the best parts of
CSH for me is that it's so easy to see everything that you can do.
** worldbuilding
what if each wing of the school had a particular theme or feeling? it would be
pretty funny to walk into the seventh grade hall, not knowing what to expect,
only to find out that they theme themselves after the ultra-refined high society
of victorian england. 

souls are remarkably like ordinary people just trying to make it through their
lives (or, well, afterlives)
** themes
when bad things happen to you, you want desperately to return to your old
life. but you can't -- not even if you solve the bad thing and return your
external world to the same state as before. it changes you inside, permanently. 

fate does not choose you, it's just that things have to happen to someone. 
** tangents
even though gpt-3 is in some sense just recombining human patterns, it is still
creating art. the strangeness of a genetic algorithm influencing art created by
humans. 

technofetishism: instead of beginning with the idea and using technology to
express it, we often begin with technology and mold our expression around what
it allows. 
* characters
** boon
boon is kind of a shinji figure. he is quiet, and well mannered, and
angsty -- but he is not depressed.

he is someone who is meek and timid, and is afraid to assert his agency. he
flinches. he has been broken at some point in his life, broken to where he
believes that he cannot take what the world throws at him and that the only
answer to life is to pre-emptively curl into the fetal position and pray that it
doesn't irreparably harm you
** barbara ann
i've got a good idea for a character forming. i keep getting the image of desire
from the sandman. someone overt, androgynous, charming, tantalizing,
colorful. someone worried deeply about the superficial pleasures of life --
seeing and being seen, checking, swiping, checking. someone whose personality is
so big that you know it cannot be real. an overcompensation in the other
direction. 

you meet this person and you dislike them, they grate on your nerves. they feel
so plastic. but you come to realize that you are truly the same as them. the
mask you wear and the mask they wear are the same, differing in color and form
but still to call the thin strip of plastic the person is flat wrong. and the
person underneath is the same.

she's an ex-cheerleader. her dad was a horrible alcoholic, but you wouldn't have
known it to know her or be around her family. he was verbally abusive. he told
her that no one would ever love her -- and do you know how hard it is to hear
that from your own parent? even when you know it's untrue? she had an eating
disorder, but not bad enough to kill her. just bad enough to keep her thin and
beautiful and validate her. the pain of being at home grew to overwhelm
her. 

then, all of a sudden, it stopped. her father died, suddenly, in a car
accident. barb couldn't get a hold on her emotions. she felt everything, relief,
hurt, pain, emptiness, joy. she had nobody to tell these things to. there was
nobody who wouldn't think her a freak for being joyful at her father's
death. they didn't understand. all she really wanted to do was to not feel
_anything_. not the good, not the bad. she just wanted to stop existing. 

so she killed herself.

i've written barb as mean in the storyboard. she's more like asuka, which isn't
quite right, because asuka is mostly _cocky_. whereas barb should be vapid,
plastic. 
** oliver
the street urchin who has been trapped in limbo for over a hundred years. but
what is the tone of his sentence? wisdom, resignation. he cannot get out of
limbo there is no hope for him, but instead of becoming despondent he resigns
himself to the situation. this is part of the theme of the game: how you handle
the tide of life.

ollie, despite being ten, is a powerful and old soul who just happens to have
been out of commission for a few decades. 

oliver calls boon sir even though he's only a week older than him. "how old were
you when you, um, you know...". he calls everyone sir, because he has those old
boarding school manners.

he speaks with an almost-british accent. everything about him screams preparatory
school.

** 03/02/2020: [code] engine architecture
@spader 3/2/2020: I want to avoid writing a lot of wrappers. Ideally, adding a
binding to the engine is one or two files. Most of the bindings into the engine
are going to be pretty thin wrappers. The layers look like this: 

Lowest level: ENGINE. 
Inside here, you have all the subsystems that actually do the work. The
rendering engine, the physics system, etc. 

Next level: API. 
Thin wrappers which are directly bound to Lua. The purpose of these
is to keep my Lua API nice and stable, and let me do whatever tricky things I
want with function signatures. Varargs, template stuff, whatever. Just register
a wrapper to Lua. 

Next level: SUGAR.
Thin wrappers in Lua. The purpose of these are purely sugar. For example, the
C++ API will take in integer IDs for entities, but I want to pass in the Lua
table because that looks natural. Write a wrapper that takes the Lua table and
forwards the ID to C++. 

Last level(?): COMPONENTS.
Components shouldn't be wrappers around the API per se -- they should put some
useful functionality on top of it. In other words, they talk to other components
and then decide what API functions to call. 

That doesn't seem too arduous. 
** 08/11/2020: [design] ideas 1
ok, fuck, let's do this. jonathan blow was playing some sweet looking indie
puzzle game. it looked like super mario world. i can do that. I can do that!
there are too many ideas brewing in this head to let them sit there, and i want
to make a small video game. i want to make a small RPG. 

complexity is born from composing simplicity. simple mechanics can make a fun
game. what are the mechanics of an RPG? 

a type chart
stats
moves
move power
split attack / defense || special attack / special defense
a team of characters
STAB
items
passive abilities
limit breaks
HP 
double battles

problem with modern JRPGs: grind. they either compose too many simple systems,
or compose complex systems. so you have to spend time to  a lot of timlearn them
before you are really playing The Game. before that, you are playing A Game, but
one that is simple and dull. satisfaction comes from making a strategy and
executing it. 

the game should have permanent death. maybe not of characters, because that can
cause degenerate strategies to be optimal (see: fire emblem). but maybe
yes. permanent death is a tradeoff. on the one hand, there are real stakes. it
is annoying to start over, and you are incentivized not to experiment lest it
fails and you die. but on the other hand, if there is no permanenet death, there
is no incentive to form good strategies. you can simply try new strategies over
and over. there is no fear as a real commander feels when his troops may die. so
what is the game trying to invoke? what is it that i enjoy most about the role
playing game? i enjoy the pit of mind against mind. the pre-game strategy, i
never quite enjoyed as much. i like going into battle and knowing my cards and
knowing their cards (for the most part) and tricking them. outwitting them. so i
would like to make a game where you can outwit. that's hard with AI. 

if the player in any way becomes weaker after losing a fight, that feels like
poor game design. how will the player overocome what just defeated him when he
is weaker than when he was defeated? 

if the player does not lose something after a fight, what incentive do they have
to win the fight? 

permadeath is good when the game is intended to be restarted frequently. but to
do that, you need some kind of procedural generation. that makes it hard to
handcraft content and avoid grinding. i want the player to be able to experiment
with different strategies. 

what about the above, but instead of procedurally generated pushing and popping,
you merely cycle through lives? what is the gameplay element of this?

(a brief aside) teaching players by guiding them
the player faces a creature that constantly heals, and must learn to use taunt
the player faces a creature that damages itself, and must learn to stall
** 08/12/2020: [design] ideas 2
check out the first picture here: https://saint11.org/blog/pixel-art-tutorials/
the black and white graphics are really awesome. just like that elias daler game
that uses four colors and is very pretty. see it here:
https://eliasdaler.github.io/tomb-painter-first-dev-log/

four colors, four colors. i can do that. 

here's an idea i had in the shower. it's similar to the idea that starts this
file. RPGs are complicated, and that's what people think makes them fun. but
what makes them fun is not complexity, but depth. related ideas, but
different. ultimate is complex -- dozens of mechanics, 80 characters, hundreds
of moves. melee is deep. now that i think about it, what are the core mechanics
of melee?

aerial attacks
grounded attacks
projectiles
shield
crouch cancel

grab/throw

jump
wavedash
ledge cancel
dash

ledge
stocks/percent
blast zones
l cancel

and that's splitting it up a lot. most of those are the RPS of
shield/grab/attack, and then movement options. that covers like 2/3 of the
game. and there's like 12 characters. but combining these things, and the fact
that you can do almost any of them out of any other of them makes it so
deep. what's a similar list for RPGs?

stats
moves
creatures
switching

types
physical/magical attacks
abilities
items
healing
boss battles
wild encounters
trainers
dungeons
leveling up/experience
evolution

i don't think that i would want to go without creatures. creatures have to be
differentiated -- i think stats and attacks have to be included. the type chart
is one of the most complex things in an RPG, and i don't think i've played one
after pokemon where i legitimately understood the type system. but you need to
have flavors, you need to have something more to differentiate them. maybe the
type system isn't something that changes damage output. maybe different types
give you different passives. or maybe it gives you access to different skill
trees. for example: every type has access to the same moves? but then that would
get much too samey. still kind of thinking competitive here. competitively, you
want to have options and mixups and hidden information. that's not as relevant
in a single player game. there, you want each battle to present a specific
challenge, a specific strategy that the player must overcome. some strategies
are plain. for example, if you had a rain dance team. some are more complex: for
example, a toxic spikes team. a good rpg forces players to form and process new
strategies at the perfect rate. let them lean on some tried and true strategies,
but force them to adapt to new wrinkles in it. 

what about a game where all you do is battle? like the battle tower. 
what about a game that is almost entirely a couple of dungeons? 
what about a game that is one long tunnel? (undertale)
what if it had elements of randomization or proceduralism?

i like it undertale style. a long tunnel. oh, also, another fun part of RPGs:
dungeons! where you need a meta strategy: not something for inside the battles,
but for managing the battles themselves. 

small idea: a boy who hears voices. the voices are spirits crossed over, and
some can be harnessed to do battle. you can embrace the madness to gain more
power, but you become unhinged. hollow ichigo.

another idea: a school deal. maybe with spirits, maybe keeping the original
hollow ichigo idea where power begets insanity. but the idea is a sixth grader,
new, who is getting bullied. maybe the school is an anime style thing where they
go to learn about battling creatures? or maybe the creatures are just the
manifestations of the other kids in the spirit world, and the player can dip
into that world, and the farther the player dips into the world the more they
lose their sanity.

what if, in the anime style, they're making fun of him for how weak his
creatures are, but they have some ridiculous name

/ha ha ha/, PLAYER, you came with THAT dodecabakumon? You're such a LOSER! /ha
ha ha ha ha/

** 08/13/2020: [design] ideas 3
eight hours feels right for this game. each dungeon is about two hours, throw in
some time for exposition and feeling out the mechanics at the beginning of the
game. 

NO TYPE SYSTEM.

no evolution? on the one hand, it is cool to see the creature you raised from
birth get super strong. on the other hand, it's a confusing mechanic for a short
game. i mean, the fact that magikarp turns into gyarados is hilarious and i
wouldn't have it any other way, but it's a big ask for the player to just figure
out on their own that they should train a magikarp to level 30. and if the
essence of the game is planning and dungeon crawling, how are they supposed to
plan for that?

pseudo randomization: be able to hot swap out different strategies for each
dungeon or for subsections of each dungeon. they'll maintain the same feel and
goals, but you could get a ton of variety for very cheap by just e.g. switching
up the order different challenges get thrown at you. 

really feeling for permadeath, but maybe with an extra mechanic that allows you
to bypass it under some circumstancs. like with reversing the time in FE3H --
although that is a little more powerful than what i would like. you need to keep
the difficulty low in the beginning to compensate for this. 

keep the core set of things small: few moves, few creatures. don't overwhelm
them. create simple, versatile moves that let you compose higher strategies. 

introduce ideas slowly. the player should never see a powerful new move or
strategy in its full form on the first time. you need to slowly morph the
player's idea of the strategies available to them. in the toxic dungeon: show
them what poison is, allow them to recover from it. show them how they can
prevent nondamaging moves with taunt. 

maybe some kind of RPS core mechanic? the thing with shield grab attack in melee
is that it is deep because of timings. you can punish whiffs with grabs, but you
can punish bad grabs with attacks. so while at the simplest level, it is an RPS
that is easy to understand, it becomes deeper at every level. a lot of that has
to do with analog things like spacing and rhythm. how do you replicate that in a
turn based game?

the ability to hot swap moves -- unlike pokemon. if the goal is to test them
strategically, why completely lock them into one set of choices to execute their
strategy? on the other hand, too much freedom lets them ignore strategy in favor
of hyper specialization. perhaps a meter that limits your change, or something
that rewards you for staying with the same team composition?

what is the RPS? is it in the game (shield grab attack), or is it meta (offense
balance stall)? what if it was all doubles? doubles has a lot more of the
RPS. what about attack / defend / grab? attack beats grab beats defend beats
attack. you need to make defending an option that does more than just stall for
a turn. core mechanic wise, not depth wise.
idea: defending an attack stuns you for a turn
idea: defending an attack cuts your stats for a turn
idea: defending an attack acts like using roar
idea: defending an attack causes the attacker to take damage


can think of a lot of ways to make this deep:
attacks can have different potencies on defending. 
defending multiple times weakens the defense (% chance to fail or reduced damage
soak)
passives that make attacks bypass defense in some way

passives are a good way to give depth to the rps. 
** 08/24/2020: [design] ideas 4
how do you win games defensively? if you choose to stall, what is your win
condition? in pokemon, it's setting up entry hazards and forcing people to
switch. spreading status. bulky stat boosters. i feel like making the 'block' do
damage could be counterintuitive. if it does chip damage -- what do you do next?
would shaving off an eighth or a quarter really do that much, especially if
(when) there are mechanics in place that makes block spamming not work. it needs
to be something that puts pressure on the offensive player to act. 

is toxic + block going to be overpowered? one thing is that that takes two move
slots. plus, offensive players have options -- stat boosts, free switches,
abilities. it might be UNDERpowered. i think blocks doing some base amount of
damage on success plus whatever passives to spice it up is a great start. 

** 09/02/2020: [code] prefabs
Here's a problem: I want to do a lot of content creation in the editor. For
example:
I want to create bounding boxes for entities in the editor.

Okay, I'm glad I did this. Why do I need prefabs? They're a good generic idea --
when there's a lot of content you want to make in the editor, you need to
serialize that out. Puting the data in a script doesn't work. Fine. Or when
you're making a game where entity types are reused often -- lots of Goombas, for
example. Then you want to have a base with sane defaults that you tweak. But I
am making neither of those games. If there are no puzzles in my game (which,
remember, keeping it simple), then there are pretty much three things in my
game:
Things you can interact with (items on the ground, save spots)
Trainers
Walls

That's seriously pretty darn close to /it/. So fuck prefabs. 
** 09/02/2020: [code] tiles
Should the game have tiles? If it's not going to be tile-based, why aren't you
just making the background in Aseprite and laying it down as a massive image? Of
course, that picture could still be composed of many tiles. But from the
engine's perspective, it's just getting a big ass background image. Then, in the
editor, you paint some simple geometry over that picture for where the walls
are. 

The upside of no tiles:
You don't have to think about the tile coordinates of your game. 
Authoring dungeons will be a lot easier, visually, in a tool like Aseprite.
Less data to save and load.
Less geometry in the game (although, you could still do the draw-bounding-boxes
approach no matter what you do with tiles).
At the end of the day, this is just the background. If you have some special
tile that you want to do something, just code it as an entity. 
** 09/04/2020: [code] what's next
How do I use images as level backgrounds?
I want to be able to extend the image without having to totally change the
geometry every time. Obviously, if I change something that exists, I'll have to
manually change the geometry. But if I, say, add a few new rooms to the level, I
don't want it to render in such a way that all the geometry is in the wrong
place. 

One solution is to make some corner of the image as the absolute (0, 0). When
you want to extend the image, you extend it away from that corner (farther out
into the quadrant). A problem with this, though: If the bottom left is your
(0, 0), then you can never go below or behind that. One way you can solve that
is to start map images as very large. And don't start drawing in the bottom
left. I mean, that would probably work. Simpler: Every map has the same size. If
you have some dungeon or map or something that is too large, just split it into
two. Be clever. If every map is the exact same size, that makes everything
pretty damn simple.

1024 x 1024 would probably work.
** 10/02/2020: [code] anew
here's what you're gonna do. pick a feature, implement it, have fun doing
it. this is something that you do to have fun and learn about programming. and
there's nothing wrong with that. 

this is the first feature: i want to load up an image of a fixed size. i want to
be able to use the editor to draw simple geometry over that image. i want that
geometry to be hooked up into the physics engine. then, i want that geometry +
image to be saved out as part of the level. simple as that -- don't want to
worry about what else goes in a save file, or how it gets serialized. 
** 10/03/2020: [code] rendering stuff
@render_refactor
so loading up the image and rendering it forced me to fix the internal
resolution stuff. i'm happy about that! some notes from that:

when we load the image to bake the texture atlas, we record its height and
width. then, when we render, we check the height and width against the internal
screen resolution, which will spit out what fraction of the screen it should
take up. 

one problem with this is that we're calculating that fraction every time

another problem is that there's no way to scale up a particular instance of
rendering a sprite. that's not a problem, because we don't need to do that, but
it is kind of weird.

the render code is doing that calculation. is that the right place for it? how
much processing should the render engine be doing? it's also building the
transform for the thing. also it has the camera...? but i guess the camera
really only effects the viewport. kinda feels like it should just be sorting the
structs and then issuing GL commands

speaking of issuing GL commands, we're issuing a glDrawElements for every
sprite. not sure how that's going to pan out. rendering a 1920x1080 thing
dropped my framerate by about 20%. 

when i'm not building the texture atlas on startup (which would be a good thing
to do soon, since that actually adds noticeable startup time), i need to write
some metadata about my assets. the program will do pretty much what it does now,
but instead of actually adding assets to the tree, we'll just write out the
height, width, number of channels, texcoords to a file. we can also dump all the
texture coordinates into an array. then you can loop over that and add all the
sprites, and just grab a pointer to the texture object and give em back to the
sprite.

one thing i'm realizing is that you have to store your entities as data. you
can't touch them in the level editor if not. reason i'm thinking about this: if
i want to add level geometry to the level, save it, and load it back, i have to
load back in at least the position and size of those boxes. 

oh, also, now is the time where i need to have several entities of the same name
existent at the same time. 

plus, if i want to do stuff like draw bounding boxes over things and move shit
around, i mean that has to go in data that gets loaded up. need to do some
design on this -- have the idea of unity prefab floating around in my
mind. because there's some data that never needs to be saved/loaded. for
example, what your animation data is. but then there's some data that pretty
much always needs to be loaded, like your position. n then how we store it -- it
would be fucking awesome to store all the data as lua scripts. there is surely a
way to do this thing. i don't want to pull in and compile a stupid json parser. 

so that's tomorrow i guess!

** 10/04/2020: [code] movement
think i fucked something up...when i move the player, he's not actually
moving. everything is moving around him. not sure what the deal is there.

but there are still collisions? so something is moving
** 10/05/2020: [code] drawing colliders
it works

you need to make it so you can see the collider before you release the mouse
(but that's easy) (tm)

what i learned today: my coordinate system got flip flopped somewhere along the
way. but if you ever need to think about it, this is how:
- the (x, y) of the camera defines where the bottom-left most part of the screen
  is being shown
- your coordinate system is inverted along both axes

so if the camera is at .2, .3, that means that the screen is like this

                             v------ (-.8, -.7) world == (1, 1) screen
[                            .]

                                    <--- my attempt at 16:9 lol





[.                            ]
 ^---- (.2, .3) world == (0, 0) screen
** 10/06/2020: [code] saving colliders
for one, i don't just want to save the file with the same name as the
level. because it sounds really useful to be able to load a couple different
states for a level.

i feel like it'd be useful to split the file into two parts: all the shit in the
level, and then some global configs. like, it'd be a really likely scenario
based on the game i have planned out that you would need to store:
- the seed used to generate the enemy layouts
- the camera
- the player's team

what DO you need to save for a level? i mean saving at playtime, not at
edittime. at edit time, you need to move shit around. add shit. all that
stuff. but at playtime, what part of that is not totally baked? so, once you
battle a trainer, you need a flag that says they're defeated. but you could
store that in the global save? but it would make more sense to store it in a
level save. because then you wouldn't have to make a unique ID that that trainer
entity knows how to load, you'd just do the normal flow of save all components
and load em back up. 

i think the best thing to do is to save most stuff in the level file for now. 

ok, so what's that look like? i think it actually looks pretty simple. when you
save a scene, we're just going to go through the entities that exist and save
them.
entity:save()
for component in entity.get_components
** 10/07/2020: [code] saving colliders 2
the general save/load cycle is pretty clear to me. what's less clear to me is
how i should lay out my entities. for example, the player looks like this:
#+BEGIN_SRC lua
function Player:init()
  local graphic = self:add_component('Graphic')
  graphic.scale = { x = .1, y = .1 }
  
  local animation = self:add_component('Animation')
  animation:batch_add(animations)
  animation:begin('spader_walk_down')
  
  local physics = self:add_component('Physics')
  local movement = self:add_component('Movement')
  local input = self:add_component('Input')
end
#+END_SRC
all of that can be defined in a table

so when i create an entity, i already know where the prefab is. there's no need
to pass that in or around -- i can just load the module from the prefabs
directory, create all the components, etc. but for a component, there's no 1:1
mapping between prefabs <-> components. in other words, the data you want to use
to create the component is associated with the specific entity you're creating
it for. 

how i want it to work:
- you can still create a component at runtime
- when init() is called, the component's data is already setup
- load and prefab work exactly the same way

so i need to make a load() function for sure. that gets called when you do load
or prefab. when you prefab, we also call init() after we load the data. 

creating a component at runtime means you have to pass in a table of data

-- later

awesome, it works :D!

main problem now is that there is no ordering of components

so for example, i want to register the collider. that needs a position and a
bounding box. i'd like to stick the registration code in one of those components
so i don't have to type it every time. but i can't know which one gets created
first, and the engine needs both of them to make the collider. so for now i have
to put it in the entity's init function

maybe late_init()?
 
** 10/08/2020: [code] saving scenes
saving entities is pretty straightforward...what i care about is the semantics
of saving levels. 

i was thinking of having a 'prefab' for a level -- all that means is a list of
the default setup of the level. what entities are there. but those entities also
need to be populated with some data. at that point, why not just use a save
file? why write the same code twice -- and it will be the same code, because
fundamentally you're just creating entities according to a list and then feeding
them in some configurations. in both cases. 

so why not make a 'scene' the same as a save file? 
** 10/13/2020: [code] what's next
make the backgrounds render in the right place
+ fix the hack used to render the background (which doesn't work right now anyway)

how the render engine figures out positions and stuff is honestly fine

i want to do the gameplay first. ah, well, fuck, that might not work -- it'd be
tough to lay out a dungeon when you don't know what it will look like. but on
the other hand, you could totally lay out all the enemies and get the battling
air tight (or at least only semiporous), and then lay out those enemies in a way
that makes sense visually. 

but before i start that, i would like to tie off some of the loose ends i have
with the editor. in particular:
- select an entity in the editor
  - save as prefab
- draw bounding boxes on an entity and store it in the prefab
- filter entity by ID
** 10/14/2020: [code] thoughts on init
i want to put some common API calls in components. like registering the
collider -- i want to put that in the physics component so i don't forget to
write that line of code in every entity that has physics. 

but there's not a good place to put that code right now. because when i create
an entity, i need to call init -- i don't know if it's going to be loaded with
some specific data right after that. but if i AM loading it right after, i'd
like to defer initialization until after that happens. 

i don't want to add another code path for "create this entity but don't load the
prefab or initialize it"...i know that at the call site

i could just do the same i do for components: pass a table into
create_entity(). when i raw create, just pass in the prefab. when i load, join
the prefab with the data. that would also stop the problems i'm having with like
registering colliders twice and shit like that
** 10/15/2020: [design] stat balance
-- during the day

if the 'creatures' are all the souls of people, then how do you make a game
where every soul isn't unique? if i see an opponent using a Timmy, and i think
Timmy is cool, then i would also like to acquire a Timmy. but there is only one
Timmy, and only one of his soul. in other words, no dice. also, if there are, i
dunno, a hundred battles in this game -- i don't want to design that many
creatures (100 * souls_per_team + whatever you can catch). 

simple idea is something like this: we've already established that the souls are
fragments. that's why they are inhuman, angry, able to be controlled. so then
there must be other such fragments. what if you could grow a soul from a simple
fragment to a more complete fragment? there's your leveling system.

another idea that just popped into my head: if you want to do evolution, the
evolutions could be the paths that the different souls could have taken in
life. maybe timmy could evolve into middle manager timmy, or loving father
timmy, or psychotic break timmy. 

you need to be able to acquire souls. so i've been thinking about this. 

one idea, slightly complex, maybe too complex for this game's size:
defeating enemies gives you soul fragments. you can use the soul fragments to
synthesize souls. maybe the fragments play double duty: you can also use them to
level up your existing souls, to restore some of their essence. 

the essences correspond to your stats. a soul has natural affinities to certain
essences, and this is reflected in how many fragments it takes to increase their
value in the essence -- one who was brawny in the physical world may only
require two fragments to increase physical attack, but five fragments to
increase special attack. 

-- later, at night

there are six stats. they're the standard ones. stats start out as bases -- this
is the actual number that the soul starts with at level one. i think i need a
damage formula to properly balance stats? you also need some kind of growth
modifier to determine how quickly an essence picks up points. the way i think it
should work is that you have a minimum number of points you can get and a
maximum number of points. this is determined by the stat maximum...? because
you'd like every soul of the same type to end up with the same base
stats. either the growth rate determines the max, or the max influences the
points allocated per. 

20 -> 120
100 points left. base growth rate is 4% -- that means, on average, allocate 4%
of the points remaining divided nby the total levels. round down.
but i mean, if you want to distribute 100 points over 29 levels, at the end of
the day you're getting ~3 points per level. that percent is meaningless.

if you just have 20 and 120, you know you need to disburse 100 points. how do
you do so over 29 levels, going between 2, 3, and 4 points, and ensure that all
100 are disbursed?

well, you can factor it into the smallest amount of points you can gain per
round, then use that as the base. in our case, you'd need 3 points per level. 

hm, i guess i don't need to figure this out to start designing souls. the point
is - you don't need an explicit growth rate, because the difference between your
base essense and your max essence IS your growth rate

so the next question: what are good ranges for where the stats end up? i need a
damage formula for this.

let's start a simple scenario:
attack = 100
defense = 100
power = 100
hp = 100 (not taken into account in damage formula)

we want it to scale positively with power and attack. and scale negatively with
defense
but this also gives some pretty big numbers for damage. assuming attack and
defense are equal -- which should probably be a 3hko given no modifiers --
damage == power. so if you imagine a 30/20 defender vs a 20 attacker, the attack
power would have to be ten. 

but wouldn't it be simple and understandable if power == damage given no
modifiers and equally matched souls? i do like that. instead of scaling the
damage formula by the level to keep the damage equal, just scale the power. 

your stats can start and end at any number or range you want. you just need them
to be big enough to give you a solid range of values to differentiate between
different souls. 

we'll say that we have thirty levels. reason: the game is three dungeons. you
want them to be close to max level (say 90%) by the final boss. party of
four. 4 * 30 = 120. 120 / 3 is 40. 40 levels per dungeon, on balance. each
dungeon should take you three hours or so. that gives you ~12 levels per
hour. so a level up every five minutes -- again, on balance, since it'll be
diminishing returns. more napkin math than anything.

i'd like to keep the stats low enough that i don't have to scale move power like
crazy, but high enough that you get the pleasant feeling of seeing more than +1
or +2. 

and i'd like to keep HP pretty much the same as the other stats

rough percentages: strong is 50% stronger than normal. 
strong = normal * 3 / 2
weak = normal * 2 / 3
normal = strong * 2 / 3
normal = weak * 3 / 2
normal = 1
=> 
weak = (2 / 3) * (2 / 3) = 4 / 9

so a if an strong attacker had 90 attack, a weak one would have 40
let's scale that up a bit
180/80.
180 means your base is probably closer to 50 -- not that you're going to get the
soul at level 1 anyway -- but that would be 130 points over 29 levels, which is
a mixture of 4s and 5s per level. 

80 / 120 / 180

so our stats are gonna vary from like 60 to 200, from the absolute worst to the
absolute best. 

hp ranges from 120, 180, 240

attack power is gonna range from like 20 to 80
** 10/16/2020: [design] first battle, mechanics
mechanics:
no types
attack
block
grab
passives
items
essences
fragments (EVs)
experience
natures

the first dungeon needs to explain these things. 

the very first battle should explain RPS and passives. then, very soon after
that you should get an item. battles give you fragments + experience. and when
you get your first soul, he can explain to you briefly about natures. that's
pretty easy. this game should be very simple to pick up, and it is. the core
rules are simple. oh, also, you should explain the stats during the first battle
-- speed makes you go first, differences between attack and special attack. all
of this explaining should take no more than five minutes.

man...lot of stuff to design. i need to make a simple plan for how to
start. because it's all connected in this web -- everything affects everything
else. so i need to pick the easiest way to start without getting caught with the
chicken and the egg.

here's the web linearized:
- souls
- moves
- passives
- items
- relative stat balance

btw here's another idea, gotta do it: each move falls into attack, block, or
grab. there are many different kinds of these moves. 

here's another idea: at the start, you only have to balance the souls that
the player can use. for all the souls that opponents have, you can just hardcode
their stats. 
** 10/17/2020: [design] story 1
awaken in the broom closet.

what does it even feel like to play this game? what is the flow of the gameplay?
i like the pace of undertale. a segment of game. talk to some people. play a
boss. 

this game is a little different, because there aren't so many minigames to break
up the pace of the game and keep it fresh. but it's also very similar -- a small
world, very foreign to our own but still somehow adjacent, that exposes itself
through characters. 

i like characters who say funny things, like:
OOH HOO HOO!

so, you awaken in a janitor's closet. you meet a young boy of about ten who was
killed in gruesome and pointless accident at school about a hundred years
ago. he is your perky guide to the underworld, as well as your first soul. he
gives you the rundown about where you are -- limbo -- and how everything works
here. some weakling trainer happens by, and you kick the shit out of him. oliver
teaches you how to battle. 

the next thing you need is some kind of goal. the main goal is to extract
yourself from the underworld. you will do this by reaching the end of the eighth
grade hall, where levi and o'doyle are holed up. their souls have begun to get
out of control, after they discovered some kind of black magick talisman which
has granted them immense power. and, of course, word has it that said talisman
has the power to eject souls from limbo. just what you need...!

but to get there, we need subplots. we need guide points. the structure of these
guide points is easy. they follow the three halls of the school. and so the
first one follows you through the sixth grade hall. but what exactly are you
doing?

here are some ideas:
- to get to the seventh grade hall, you need some key. 
- the exit of o'doyle and levi from the sixth grade hall has left a power
  vacuum. they could probably help you get farther, but everything's in such
  disarray...

i actually like the second one quite a bit. there is a lot of room for
flavor. the idea of a wing of hell in revolt is a good setup for why you're
fighting these people all the time. you could have a cool boss battle at the end
where there are several interesting characters vying for the new title of king
of sixth grade. and you must pick amongst them, or they tag team you, or run you
through a gauntlet. 
** 10/18/2020: [design] story 2
ah so yes, there is some power struggle amongst the sixth graders. your first
task is to become their king -- you don't know that you're to become their king
of course, but you will progress through their domain until you defeat the
strongest among them. 

** 01/01/2021: [planning] hello!
watching the hawks game now. my prediction: the hawks will win a playoff series
this year. i think if they get a couple more years of development for the young
guys and one solid free agent -- hell, they have a lot of trade leverage because
they have good young guys on cheap contracts -- then they are a really scary
team. 

i want to start with some high level planning. and maybe some meta planning. the
general structure for what i want to do is this: develop the tone of the
game. it's less important to think about translating this into
audiovisual. first of all, that's not your forte. even if you have the tone of
the game nailed down precisely, you would not be able to take that precise idea
and turn it into a visual theme. even harder if the tone is not a very precise
thing. second of all, it's too early to hammer that out. just wait until you get
someone who is good at that. remember the jonathan blow braid talk. 

developing the tone of the game means: 


- what are the prevailing emotions the game makes you feel? 
does it make you feel queer and fey?
does it make you feel afraid?
does it make you feel empty?
does it fill you with spirit? 

what does the ending of the game make you feel?
does this game make you think?
what ideas and themes do you want to spread through the game? (i love themes, i
love connections, i love symbolism). 

don't worry about HOW these things happen for this question. remember
rule 7. anything is possible. 

A:
wow. welcome to the hot seat, buddy. you can do anything, and it sure feels
overwhelming. you know, the main inspiration for the tone and set pieces so far
has been sandman. and i really like that. i like that because sandman is really
consisten in its style, but has such a wide range of what it can make you
feel. there's a lot of horror in it (24 hours in the diner, calliope), but also
a lot of humor (serial killer convention, cleaning the demons out of hell), very
fey and surreal (midsummer, hippolyta and the sandman), painful (family
relationships, his wife). but through it all, it is dark, it is grand, it is
literary. 

i want emptiness and lack of control to be a theme. fate and gravity, being
drawn towards people and ripped from them. feeling weak and powerless over your
life and your own emotions. and then feeling isolated and empty after that. 

i want the player to feel like they are being pulled through this world by an
invisible current. 

i want the player to feel like the nature of the world and their surroundings is
fixed. a law of nature rather than something malleable

i want boon to be somewhat helpless -- the image that is sticking out in my mind
is a big, burly man's man clapping him on the shoulder good naturedly and boon
just feeling totally alienated and isolated.

but the game should not be totally depressing. the game should be full of life,
because life is full of life. it should be funny at times, even if in a darkly
funny way. 

i want the world to be absurd in its blatant acceptance of cause and effect, of
the nature of the world. as in, maybe a character says that you've got to do
this series of highly specific and unpleasant things to get what you want. and
when you ask why, they look at you quizzically as if they do not understand --
that is merely the way the world is, and that cannot be changed. 

i don't know how i feel about simple images: the names of buildings and people,
logos, stuff like that.


- what is the writing style -- are there any other writers or games you can
  point to? 

i want there to be quiet conversations between two characters, like in a
murakami novel. i want the characters to narrate their feelings and thoughts and
the ideas of the game as dialogue in these scenes. 


- how does the player learn how to play the game?
i mean, i have a basic idea of this. building up strategies in the enemies you
battle. simple battles at the beginning to show mechanics. but i think it's a
good idea to flesh this out more: how do players get the ability to customize
their team and develop strategies? this is kind of a problem with the mainline
pokemon games. you just kind of pick up whatever pokemon you find, and the only
sense you have of creating a strategy is padding out type disadvantages. 

but also: what are some specific ways i can show the player what strategies are
in the game? clearly, a lot of it has to be through the battles that you
face. dialogue along with that. but flesh those out into more concrete ideas.


- what are some characters you want to put in the game?
you don't slash can't slash shouldn't try to make all the characters in the game
up front. there will be characters added after planning, and characters cut
after planning. but a good story needs to have good characters, so make up some
good characters. of course, try to have an idea of where they are in the game --
as part of killing bruce, try to be more focused than spending weeks making
characters who will never see the light of day -- but don't stress too much
about the characters fitting in perfectly. 


- what does an hour of gameplay look like?
what's the pace of the game like? 
how do you make the game more than walking along a hallway doing battles? this
is actually an advantage of shitty random battles -- this is pretty much solved
for you. routes and dungeons don't have to be interesting except at set points. 
how often are you in towns? 
how are the dungeons laid out in relation to the locales?
how does talking to the characters and dialogue play into the gameplay? is it
formalized like a quest? is it informal like undertale?
does the game have any puzzles?


- what are the locales of the game?
towns, buildings in towns. give it character. think undertale.


- how is the game divided?
how long is it?
what's the plot structure -- is it divided into arcs, and if so how many?
again, setting out a grand plot structure can be nebulous when the plot that
comes to be doesn't fit in the structure. but you're making guidelines more than
anything. the guideline was good to have when i was writing the first game. it
helped me figure where a boss needed to go, where a dungeon needed to go. 
** 01/02/2021: [planning] answering ?s
little summary from yesterday: the world should be gray and absurd, humorous,
and the player should feel as if they are being dragged along through a strange
world that has an internal consistency but a surreal consistency and a fixed
nature. 

WRITING STYLE
okay, so from yesterday: quiet conversations between two characters, like
murakami, where they explain key points of the game through their thoughts. they
express ideas, themes, and they themselves should be symbols in what they think
and say. 

most of the writing is dialogue, i just realized. besides flavor text, it's all
dialogue. so the writing style depends heavily on the characters and their
voices. 

CHARACTERS
i want the characters to be few and big. not big as in wheel of time big --
fleshed out through dozens and dozens of conversations -- but having a distict
personality. i really lovs sans. in fact, i like the whole undertale model of
characters. there aren't too many characters that talk, but you'll remember
every single one who does. and the ones that don't still have a personality to
them. 

boon is kind of a shinji figure. he is quiet, and well mannered, and
angsty. there's going to be a main sidekick that guides him through the world,
someone of experience. what is the relationship between these two like? i love
the idea of oliver, the street urchin who has been trapped in limbo for over a
hundred years. but what is the tone of his sentence? wisdom, resignation. he
cannot get out of limbo (note: what if this is a decision you can make at the
end of the game?). there is no hope for him, but instead of becoming despondent
he resigns himself to the situation. this is part of the theme of the game: how
you handle the tide of life. 

the one problem with oliver being this wise yet resigned character is who spurs
boon forth? boon is another facet of how we handle life. he is someone who is
meek and timid, and is afraid to assert his agency. upon second thought, i don't
think he is depressed. he just flinches. he has been broken at some point in his
life, broken to where he believes that he cannot take what the world throws at
him and that the only answer to life is to pre-emptively curl into the fetal
position and pray that it doesn't irreparably harm you. how do you get a
character like that to take decisive action? well, the whole arc of the game is
boon overcoming this outlook. 

so maybe the dynamic between oliver and boon is this: oliver sees that boon
could escape, so he decides to help him. oliver is resigned to his own fate, but
he is not resigned as a personality trait. and there are some conversations that
explore oliver's feelings about his being trapped. 

GAMEPLAY
okay, this is a hard one. i want every battle to be handcrafted, out in the
open. that means no random battles. playing through, say, FF6, if you took out
the random battles then you're seriously walking from place to place. and i
don't think that random battles are interesting enough to break that up. 

the one idea that i have is puzzles, but the problem with that is that this is
supposed to be a small game, a focused game, and i think that by putting in
puzzles i am going to start getting in over my head (especially with the effort
needed to make GOOD puzzles). i would rather have really good and tight battles
and combat design. 

undertale solves this in a fucking brilliant way. it keeps the random battles,
but they're all minigames. well, before i brainstorm about this, let me lay out
the game on a slightly higher level.

the game is essentially a "walk right" game. there's no backtracking. you don't
diverge in the order you beat different parts. there are a few main hubs -- at
least one for each grade. and then there are smaller little outposts that you
hit. there are no quests, at least not in the traditional sense (go here, do
this thing, then come back to me). there are things you can do in the
towns. brainstorm
you can have seemingly innocuous conversations with people that may subtly
influence other parts of the game
resolving a conflict between two people that gets you a one-off battle and a
neat item at the end
mini-dungeons -- think of the dojo in cerulean city
hidden mini dungeons
shops, inns

i think the important thing is to pack detail in the towns. everyone you talk to
should be opening up some small gameplay, or giving you a good conversation. the
people in the town should connect. the towns are not big, they are not a focal
point of the game, but i want them to feel less like waypoints and more like
breathing entities (not to the extent that, say, vampire breathes. but breath
nonetheless).

so yes: hubs, outposts, and then what i will call dungeons. a dungeon is any
section of the game that is focused on combat between two hubs or outposts. 

outposts are more there for plot and scenery breakup, i think. like, i can put a
heal point anywhere in the dungeon to break it up into functionally two
dungeons. so maybe outposts take the place of heal points? maybe outposts can be
really tiny things, like a single house, packed with personality, and that is
just what a heal point is. but if the layout of the game is the three grades and
then maybe an intro city, i don't think you want to have them playing for like
two to three hours straight doing a whole grade without really talking to
anyone. so these outposts can also be plot points. put macguffins there, etc. 

one thing though: i definitely want dialogue to be a formal part of the
game. choices you can make -- at least in the smaller parts of the game, like
the mini quests. or it is silently impactful (take a conversation one way, item
A shows up late game, take it the other way, item B)

DIVISION
three grades. with an introduction. keep it easy. everyone is under levi and
o'doyle. the sixth graders are minor bosses, the seventh graders are a little
higher in the pecking order. so as you go along, you get closer to the top and
you learn more about how it's being run. 
** 01/03/2021: [planning] differentiate
i don't know how the hell the gameplay looks with no random encounters. I just
looked into cosmic star heroine a little more and it basically has random
encounters. well, that's not totally fair -- it doesn't. there are monsters that
you can see on the screen. i guess because of how they look it doesn't feel
different than random encounters, but it really is. it's the same as i want to
do: every encounter is designed. 

alright, so check this: make the game a little less of a rightwalker. there are
doors with keys...almost like simple 2D zelda puzzles? 

kind of an aside. one thing i didn't like about the (admittedly few) videos i
watched about CSH was that the game does not make you feel. it has a certain
style to it, a certain consistency, but not one that is special. i want this
game to be ethereal, strange, fey. 
 
so there are these small sub-tasks in the dungeons that keep things
interesting. you end up doing something like 30-40 minutes of battles, then you
come to some way point. the waypoints join together into larger sections. the
waypoints provide you with intermediate goals to make the game feel
cohesive. the levels can have some mild backtracking. but it's all about
stringing together these intermediate goals between the big hubs. this feels
kind of nebuluous writing it but clearer in my mind. i think this will flesh out
more as i design the game.
** 01/04/2021: [planning] limbo ideas
think these entries are going to just be summaries sometimes. i'm going to start
designing the world, the hubs. maybe some waypoints, but i think those will be
tied more to the story.

the first place you will enter is limbo. limbo is the space between the
grades. you wake up in some designated room of limbo, the room where newly
damned souls enter. limbo is one of the four hubs of the game (the other three
being the three middle school grades). the three grades are long hallways that
stretch like three fingers from the palm that is limbo. it is a place that you
will return to after each dungeon. limbo is the largest hub of the game, and
after each dungeon, things become unlocked in it. brainstorm for some places in
limbo

a bar where wayward souls gather. there could be a lot of conversations
here. there could be a hidden room in the back of the bar that the keep allows
you into if you smooth talk the right way. people could ask you to retreive
their lost items from the different grades

an old teacher's soul whose mind has not adjusted to the afterlife, and holds
raving lessons in the town square

some souls that have taken up an ordinary life in limbo. an irony there --
living the afterlife just as you lived the life. fate throws you a curveball
but you haven't even walked up to the plate yet. 

another idea: everyone you talk to in limbo is a part of the graph. they are all
connected by degrees. 

a library, with a strange and otherworldly librarian. one who seems to know too
much of the world to be a simple librarian, almost like hoid. 

a warehouse that holds a secret entrance into one of the grades. (maybe this is
the gym). i would love it if there were a talking basketball in one of the
gyms. as in, everything has a soul, and even the souls of inanimate objects may
manifest themselves strongly enough to be conscious in the afterlife. 

i think you could also have many 'ordinary' buildings -- places of work,
dwellings, that don't mean anything on their own, but take place in these small
stories that emerge through the hub. 

so the point of the hub is that it is this (relative to the game size) large
place which is full of life, secrets, and sendings-off. as i think about it,
since you return to the hub, it may be best to have it be the ONLY hub, and to
truly have the grades be dungeons. this also keeps the game down to a much more
manageable size and length -- and more like the length i was intending for it to
be. lets me pack in the details that i want while still keeping it short. so the
game then becomes periods of, say, an hour in the hub. sorting things out,
figuring out how to get into the next grade. then, say, two hours to run the
dungeon. which puts you at about 8-10 hours (1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2). which could
be extended a bit by adding in mini-dungeons. 

so i think the next thing to do is to figure out what takes place in between you
landing in limbo and you starting the first dungeon. how do you get there? how
do you learn the mechanics of the game? what places and people are involved? are
there multiple ways to do it? what side items are available in that time?

who are ollie's friends? how many integral characters does this game have? like,
i don't think there should be five more people that you meet there. the game
simply isn't long enough to really flesh them out. ollie is totally fine as far
as development, because he's always with you. there could be, say, three souls
there. and each one is a jumping off point for the different grades. so each one
gets to be developed. but it kind of sucks that you deal with the first one to
get to 6th grade and then never again for the rest of the game. that might not
be so bad for two reasons: for one, these secondary characters can be tied into
the network of the hub. you can run into them at other places. for two, they can
always be there giving input when you return to the hub and for you to talk to
after you have been briefed. 

so let's say there are three damned souls. are they extensions of the themes of
the game? are they different manifestations of how we deal with suffering? or
are they just interesting traits wrapped up in a human shell? is their main
purpose to push the themes? like, are they designed around that, or are they
designed around being cool characters and then the theme is bolted onto them?

hey, here's another thought: don't be too deadly serious with these
characters. i mean, i don't want to be as silly as undertale, but the reason
undertale is so fucking awesome is because the characters are really big, and
silly, and funny. 

brainstormin:

T. A. Milliken, a teenaged boy dressed in a fine bespoke uniform, who is from
old textile money. He's a bit haughty, but not maliciously so. He is a bit of a
buffoon, but ultimately a loveable one. 
** 01/05/2021: [planning] more brainstorm
what are ways that we deal with our lives? we take drugs. we become
depressed. we distract ourselves with meaningless things. we pretend things are
meaningful. we surround ourselves with people. we become promiscuous. we lock
ourselves in our rooms. we feel empty. we curl up into a ball and pray that we
are not kicked again. we overcompensate and become manic. 

i like the idea of these four characters at the center of...some story. maybe
it's not the main story. maybe the main story continues to be a boy and an
unlikely companion trying against the odds of what is known and possible to
overcome fate. you know, maybe here's another idea popping up: why we do things,
and the selfishness therein. boon is eradicating evil, yes, but he's doing it
purely selfishly.

these three characters could be the core of the goings-on in the hub. of the
sidequests, of all the people. the center of the network. let me also look at
some of the side characters from the last game...

i've got a good idea for a character forming. i keep getting the image of desire
from the sandman. someone overt, androgynous, charming, tantalizing,
colorful. someone worried deeply about the superficial pleasures of life --
seeing and being seen, checking, swiping, checking. someone whose personality is
so big that you know it cannot be real. an overcompensation in the other
direction. you meet this person and you dislike them, they grate on your
nerves. they feel so plastic. but you come to realize that you are truly the
same as them. the mask you wear and the mask they wear are the same, differing
in color and form but still to call the thin strip of plastic the person is flat
wrong. and the person underneath is the same. 

barbara (a.k.a barb)

she's an ex-cheerleader. her dad was a horrible alcoholic, but you wouldn't have
known it to know her or be around her family. he was verbally abusive. he told
her that no one would ever love her -- and do you know how hard it is to hear
that from your own parent? even when you know it's untrue? she had an eating
disorder, but not bad enough to kill her. just bad enough to keep her thin and
beautiful and validate her. the pain of being at home grew to overwhelm
her. then, all of a sudden, it stopped. her father died, suddenly, in a car
accident. barb couldn't get a hold on her emotions. she felt everything, relief,
hurt, pain, emptiness, joy. she had nobody to tell these things to. there was
nobody who wouldn't think her a freak for being joyful at her father's
death. they didn't understand. all she really wanted to do was to not feel
_anything_. not the good, not the bad. she just wanted to stop existing. 

so she killed herself.

in the afterlife, things don't change so much. it's weird -- you think that fate
is something that affects the living. fate is all these things that get thrown
at you and happen to you, and you juggle them until you feel like the dishes are
about to drop and at the last second you stumble across the finish line and all
the dishes break but it's okay -- they aren't your responsibility any
more. you've made it. you can breathe a sigh of relief. but all those feelings
that fate laid on you, they don't just end. now that you're dead, they're just
there, forever, morphing yes but so slowly that it is almost unbearable. 

even the dead have to cope!
** 01/06/2021: 
i got a cat today :) here's some stuff i wrote while i was waiting for jonathan

i'm excited for the barb character. one thing i was thinking about today is how
do i have emotionally tense scenes? you can't really have long shots showing the
characters acting. well, you can, because a computer can do anything. but i
think that's too much for what i want this game to be. it's not necessarily
emotional tension that i'm after, but rather depth and connectedness and
emotional realism. showing broken people cope, and showing a community of people
living together and how they interact and are so tightly wound around each
other. how the actions of one, tiny actions, can have great rippling effects. 

so barb is a young girl. teenaged, sweet sixteen. i think i need to have someone
older in the cast as well. there's another aspect of suffering: someone who is
ground down not by tragedy but by the daily condition of life. an old man for
whom his senior year of high school was the peak of his life. and not even
because it was so great -- although it _was_ a very good time -- but moreso
because he held so much hope for the future. it was wide open. and as the weight
of adulthood bears down on him, he slowly becomes flatter, slower, older. and
when he dies, his soul returns to its time of greatest joy. he's not an overtly
sad man. he doesn't loudly sigh and look off into the distance. his pain isn't
really pain per se, it's just that his feeling and emotions have been ground
down into corn field flat plains. but what makes the player care about him if he
is so flat? what is his motive for being in a pseudo political organization that
knows things about the goings-on of the enemy? why would he do any of these
tings if he derives no pleasure or pain from them?
** 01/07/2021: [planning] schedule
back at it. so the two threads i have to pull on now are: who are the main
people who populate this world, and how do you get to the first dungeon? first,
though, i want to do a little more meta planning. rough list of big things that
need to happen:
- first draft of the plot slash structure  - sketch main characters
  - each section: intro, first dungeon, interlude, second, interlude, third,
    final boss
  - hub design
- design the game itself
  - battle system
  - dungeons
- program the thing
  - dialogue
  - battling
  - persistence
  - tools
- promotion
- find an artist
- concept art
- converting programmer art to production art
- polish
- package it for sale

i think i could finish the plot except really hammering down the connectedness
of the hub in a month. so maybe there are some things to do in the hub, the main
thrust of what you do there in the interludes is fleshed out, but all the fine
details are not ironed out

the programming...honestly, i could see that taking at least 6-8 months. i could
also see it taking more, but that feels like a realistic number to shoot
for. that being because i have my tools, i know them well, i have a good idea
for where they are. and they are pretty solid.

designing the game will take a while. on the order of 3 months or more to get a
rough cut. but a lot of that will happen with programming it and playing it. 

i would want like a month to screen artists -- but this can be totally
concurrent. and then i would expect 4-6 months for them to do the art. somewhat
parallelizable, but i would certainly not want to hire an artist at the end of
first draft stage because i know the game is going to change as i program
it. that's something i would do around the end of "first programming draft". 

then polishing it overlaps like 3 months with the artist. kind of a catch all
for "make the game better", "alpha test", "integrate real art and fix bugs
produced therefrom". you could spend 6 months polishing it methinks.

promotion happens while you are programming it -- maybe on that tail end where
you have the artist churning out concept art. promoting and polishing are kind
of the same time slot.

packaging it for sale i think would take like 3 weeks. 

min / max
1 / 1 (plot rough cut)
6 / 8 (program rough cut)
3 / 4 (design rough cut)
1 / 1 (art screen)
4 / 6 (art)
6 / 6 (polish)
6 / 6 (promotion)
1 / 1 (packaging)

1 + 6 + 3 + 6 + 1 = 17 months for a low estimate of all the serial work i am
doing. if you're working an hour a day that's 500 hours. two hours a day, a
thousand. 

gonna set some dates for finishing rough plot/design and then once i get there
break down the 'grammin. 

ok, back to the regularly scheduled programming!

so we've got barb and we've got bradshaw. i want to have the third character set
in place here before i figure out what you have to do to get to the first
dungeon. both characters are still very underdeveloped, but that's ok. 

what about a character that is an artist? but like, a squidward kind of
artist. a bruce who is also a talentless hack. a painter, call him, who died in
middle age without having accomplished anything of note. the reason that he
painted was not because he loved painting, but because he had some success with
it as a child. it gave him a feeling of satisfaction and self worth. as he
became older, he became depressed. his life felt empty and meaningless. (oh, by
the way, we will call him bruce). he felt like his life had to have meaning, but
he was too afraid of actual success and dedication to make his life had
meaning. he was in love with the idea of life having meaning rather than the
meaning itself. any meaning would do. so anyway, he "sets out" to paint this
great painting. the most beautiful painting you've ever seen. to be a painter
that could not be forgotten. but it is a false setting out. he never intends to
accomplish anything. occasionally, he saw and felt glimpses of this. the hardest
thing to overcome was: what have you accomplished? the important thing being:
the way he chose to cope with suffering was by self-deception.

he grew rounder, grew to middle age, and there was nothing in his life worth
preserving. he died, of something stupid, a congenital heart defect or something
pointless like that. and that was it. there was nothing.
** 01/08/2021: 
one thing i've been thinking about these characters: remember that this is a
video game. this isn't an art movie. i have a certain disdain for self centered
art movie style of thing, not that i watch a lot of art movies. but things that
tell stories that don't mean very much to those watching it and are very
specific to those who made it. so i'm writing this to say: don't worry so much
about putting in tense scenes, don't worry so hard about what the characters
represent or what their pain is. just focus on making them have interesting
backstories or personalities and fit loosely into the story and themes and they
will write themselves. you need to be excited about them.

like barb. i am super excited about her. i have a good idea of how i want to
write her, and i think it will be an awesome experience for the player to come
to like and empathize with this person that you once hated or found annoying. i
think that will be fun to write and fun to play.

i also like the old man, because people get really emotional about old men. and
i can see a lot of possibilities, a lot of ways to rope you into feeling
something real for this pixelated character.

not sure how i feel about bruce though. bruce just doesn't feel video game-y
enough to me. barb and the old man are "big" personalities. better put, they are
strong personalities. they have clearly defined traits. this is kind of the idea
of why i like sans so much as a character and why i think he works so well. sans
is so sans that it hurts. everything about him is himself. you need that in a
video game -- any video game, but especially a 2D one. you lose a lot of modes
of expression in a video game. tones of voice, facial expressions. so you need
the character to be strong as a character. no people as just themes. and bruce
feels more like a theme to me. 

i also want to keep with the school theme a little more. altho i do like the
idea of changing the old man to instead of someone who peaked in high school and
that's why he returns here in death to an old teacher who died on the job. like,
the kind of teacher who teaches until they're 80 and then just nods off in third
period on day and kicks the fuckin bucket. and that would work a lot better with
the school theme.

here's another idea: a mom. a very bubbly woman, big hips and shoulder length
hair. her elementary-aged son died. she puts on a face. she smiles, she's polite
at PTA meetings, she goes for a drink with the gals at work occasionally. but
she's just dead inside. kelly...

how do i tie all of these characters together? the initial idea was to have
oliver bring you to what is in essence a cantina -- because all good stories
start at cantinas -- and then introduce you to a few characters who tell you
what's going on. but maybe that's not the way to do it...? the problem is that
characters scheming in the cantina against the enemy is a very _political_ kind
of thing. for that to be really engaging, you want to have an involvde plot with
plenty of room for twists and turns and backstabbing. you want a game of thrones
situation. and this game is not that. this game is about simple characters and
stories, but real characters and stories. real emotion and intrigue packed into
each part of the game. so there shouldn't be a lot of main characters, and i
think that by introducing all these characters at the start you're kind of
setting yourself up for a game where you DO have a lot of main characters. these
that you're developing should be the 'secondary characters'. 

ok, so i'm gonna rock with that. now, there are two ways i could go with
this. the first is that i could have all three characters be interchangable in
their order. the second is that i could dictate the order. the former would be a
little harder to program. maybe a lot harder to program, considering the
connectedness component. as in, if you want all of the small characters in the
hub to overlap, then you want these three secondary characters to be a key piece
of that. but it gets hairy about how they handle these characters depending on
if you have done their quest or not. of course, you could program it in, but it
would be a lot of work to make sure that the game is not just coherent in every
configuration but still keeps the same emotionality. makes the same emotional
sense.

another kind of problem i'm seeing is how you actually get to know these
secondary characters if you're only with them for a short time. well, the
interlude arcs are going to be like little vignettes. stories that are meant to
be told quickly. 

what if the third character was the mysterious librarian? the soul who knows
more than he should? so he gets introduced early, you go talk to him as a part
of the 

ooohhhh

ok, i got it

so when you first land, ollie picks you up. he tells you that you should
probably go talk to the librarian, because some strange things have been
happening. you know -- this is kind of the guy who knows what's going on in the
world. afterworld. nice and simple. so the librarian kind of points you in the
right direction for the first interlude. ditto for the second interlude. and
then, he IS the third interlude. 

how does barb know how to get into the 
** 01/09/2021:
just wrote some plot today
** 01/10/2021: [story] sidequests, connectedness
just wrote some plot today

BUT IN ADDITION TO THAT

i will also work on some more stuff. i'll work on...the first vignette. real
business time. ok, so the way i'm thinking this is set up is that the librarian
gives you this talk

and i'm just now realizing that i forgot that you are playing a game, and that
you need to, you know, do some battling. and that the librarian needs to show
you how to battle. so stick that in at the end.

so the librarian gives you this talk where he gives you a little rundown on some
metaphysics and the general situation in limbo and, loosely, what you need to do
to not be there permanently. and he says: alright, that's all i know, you're
gonna have to figure out the rest. this is part of the theme of the game here:
fate happens, and then you must deal with it. this is definitely in part a kafka
ripoff, and i'm not sure how it will come across in the game. it could very
easily come across as "just meander around until something happens and then you
can keep playing the game". maybe it's better to point them in a specific
direction? 

been thinking for a good minute, coming up a bit blank. so here's a thread to
pull on: how do i create this small yet tight and complex world of people and
things? i keep having this thought that maybe one character tells you to go talk
to another one...not even really a conscious thought, just one of those things
that pops up in my head. let me brainstorm. 


different dialogue options pop up for the different characters you talk to
depending on what you have learned about them. for example, maybe you walk into
kristina's house and she tells you that she is pregnant. then later, when you're
talking to jerry, that either directly or subtly alters the conversation you can
have with him. 


a large mystery to be unravelled? but one that is unrelated to the plot at
hand. i'm looking for something here with just enough of a hook to pull you in,
but no more than that. any less, and you wouldn't even realize there was a
mystery there. certainly no quest marker shit. 


lost shorts. something that starts out innocuous that grows out of hand.


everyone in the town talks shit on crazy eddie. he was a homeless guy who, in
life, liked to hang around the school and (genuinely) befriend the kids and
sleep out behind the gym. 

(hey, an aside: i'm kind of realizing that not every story in the game has to be
connected to every other story. that would be massive and absurd. for one, focus
on making all these sidequests punchy and poignant and chestaching.)

so he sleeps out behind the gym, and day, crazy eddie just dies. in the way that
homeless people do sometimes. back in limbo, crazy eddie is being
annoying. he's been a real spiritual asshole, and wouldn't you go try to talk
some sense in to him seeing as you're the new kid? so you go down and talk to
crazy eddie and he doesn't really make a lot of sense -- but what you can
surmise is that his normal haunt is, well, haunted. there are some
less-than-kind spirits there. you knock 'em out, and then crazy eddie says to
you: thank you. you're the first person that's been kind to me in longer than i
can fathom. do you know hard it is to be crazy? actually -- being crazy is
really easy. you live in your own personal reality. it's the brief moments where
you snap back. that doesn't happen for everyone, but it happens for me. every
once in a while, i'll come to, and i'll look at myself, my unwashed body, my
tattered clothes, my stench, and i'll feel a self hatred that cuts through me
like a hot knife. and i'll know that nobody could ever love me, and that i do
not deserve kindness. and i'll tough it out until i lose myself again in my
illness. it always comes back, thankfully, because then the hard part is over. 
** 01/11/2021: 
i never tell the player to get you a soda. 

i don't want to just tell the player to "go and talk to this person". that
doesn't feel right in the spirit of this game -- the feyness, the
surrealness. but also remember: this is a game. not a pixellated diary. it has
to be fun. and especially in the beginning, the player is gonna want to play the
game. is it fun for the player to go around talking to people? no, it is not --
UNLESS they can pick up some quick adventures. get sucked into a story, or to a
side dungeon. so maybe the librarian actually pushes you forward. 

okay, but the librarian as the all-knower telling you to let fate lead you on is
way more in line with what i want. i think the better option is to ok yea im
just gonna write this in the plot section

-- later

okay, the problem now is that i want them to go to the cafeteria and get into
some nonsense, but if i send them there without a plan then i have to figure out
how to direct them to the right place given that they could talk to pretty much
anyone there.

i could have them go there but then have some of it blocked off. 

i could have ollie suggest you get to a specific place within the cafeteria, but
then that would kind of defeat the purpose. 

i could have them go there but then some kind of barely-cutscene pulls them in
the right direction.

i could have them go there but all the people by the entrance have an extra
dialogue option called "do you know how the fuck to get to sixth grade" and they
point in some direction.

i think i like that last one -- question is what that direction is. 

well, remember. barb and the old man. you want to pull to barb first. so what if
the first vignette is twofold: finding barb, then a mini dungeon to get to sixth
grade. but you want to spend time with barb. they should be accompanying you on
the vignettes. i think it would be a cool idea to have this hunt for barb. this
guy said she was over here, that guy said she was over there. bust into the
wrong place and get a cool battle. but also: they should be accompanying
you. the whole point of barb is this character that you're stuck with, and you
come to hate, and then you come to feel a deep empathy with. and ALSO ALSO, this
first bit needs to be pretty combat intensive. lots of easier battles to get
them used to the combat system. 

so what if you ask around a bit and everyone says, yeah, there's this chick barb
who hung around there a lot, but the last time we heard from her was ___. then
you go there, just pretend it's a restaurant for metaphor's sake, you go to the
restaurant and you hear a girl calling from the walk in. you walk in to
investigate. and the door slams shut behind you. now you're both trapped. and
now you've got to make your way out of here. 
** 01/12/2021: [story] art room, interludes?, creatures?
school room. so barb used to hang out at the sixth grade hall, but we haven't
heard from her -- as in, we're pretty sure that she isn't _there_, but we just
don't know where she is. we saw her hanging around....where? 

ok, here's an idea: we saw her hanging around the art room. when you get to the
art room, she's trapped in a painting. and there's this short puzzle inside the
art room to lead you to find the painting. 

riddles?

are there people in the art room? i want this to feel a little hazy. a little
preordained. 

you are being tied together with this person for a moment in time. linked to
them -- but the link is against your will. a chain? and when you become tied to
a person, it is in a sense forever. your experiences with that person do not
leave you when they leave you. a chain is an ugly thing. i prefer a knot. 

a knot that looks like ok yea

sixth grade hall: 
barb has a loose idea of what's going on from being trapped
lots of henchmen
a minor boss at the end who really clues you into what's going on. maybe he's
kind of goofy?

should you just be able to battle with barb oliver and boon? i think that even
20 creatures is kind of tough to pack into a 3 dungeon game. like you have to be
able to find all of them, have time to level them up...you can still have items
be the result of sidequests. items, moves, abilities, anything like that. 

and should i have these interlude sections? the way the barb one is set up, it's
pretty much like it's the dungeon itself. like i'm planning on having these
little plot points scattered through the dungeon anyway, so is this really any
different? well, for barb, maybe it's not so different. because her thing is
getting you _into_ the dungeon. but for #2 and #3, that doesn't have to
necessarily be the case. i mean, even for barb, it could be something like:
yeah, i've been sneaking into the sixth grade for a while now, and i could tell
you how i do it, but first i need to get the fuck out of wherever we are now. so
you do that, get her out, then return to talk to the librarian who lets you
know:
there are two personality wells that have collided and are tearing the realm
apart
you are one of them
the world's internal rules are becoming un-self-consistent

or phrased slightly differently

all things are preordained
boon was supposed to die in the closet
but for some reason, he did not, which broke fate
since all things are preordained, if the mechanism of preordaining breaks, then
it threatens to tear apart the realm at the seams. 

^^ that would kind of imply though that the villains took over after boon got
his shit kicked in...? whereas i was kinda going for "alter-egos in spirit world
become corrupted and infect their corporeal counterparts). it would be awesome
though if boon had to die at the end. or maybe the breaking of fate was not at
an instant, but a slow fracture, and the villains manifest as a part of that
initial warping...and you have to defeat them before the whole thing cracks into
a million pieces.

also, side note: develop the main villains more. i think they are pretty boring
now. well, you gotta have some interaction with them before the final
boss. maybe after the seventh grade. 

you should be able to hot swap anything on characters. no EV bullshit. 
** 01/13/2021: 
lol kind of phoning it in today but that's ok. 

so yesterday i was kind of working on the big picture of the plot, especially as
it relates to the first interlude. i was feeling pretty good too. i like this
part.

so yeah you go do the little arc with barb, you have your moment with her, you
defeat the beastie or beasties that are keeping you trapped, and then you return
to the hub to talk to the librarian. and he's gonna give you the rundown. 
** 01/14/2021: 
having a lot of thoughts about the creature system in this game. about having
the NPCs be the same as the creatures. it makes some things easier but other
things harder. the thing i keep coming back to, though, is the fact that the
game is too short to really have a fleshed out creature system. the doubt i was
having was related to dialogue and such: if you have this fleshed out character
like barb, how do you meaningfully make her a part of the story beyond her arc
when she may or may not be a part of your party. 

so what's good with this first interlude. remember -- short, simple, sweet. this
isn't the first dungeon. it's mainly just a place where you can learn how to
battle. not a lot of plot is going to happen here. 

thinking you're basically gonna walk along, stop and talk with barb every once
in a while. you overhear a guard saying something about a weird painting of a
knot in a room at the end of the hall. when you get there, there's a lil mini
boss -- just the captain for the squad that's patrolling this hall, not even
enough to give him a name, really. and he takes barb half hostage. and boon has
the choice to run through the painting or to save barb first (maybe this is an
actual player choice, maybe it's just a choice that in game boon has that is noy
role played)). something to make barb open up to them at the end.  

what does the interlude section look like? 
well, speaking outside of flavor, i'm thinking of it as mostly hallways with a
few small places where it opens up. maybe it's a whole art themed thing? lol
thinking of metaphysical justifications but i don't think i need them. what's
the tone of it? it's a twisted projection of an art room. but not in a funhouse
style, with oversized paintbrushes. it warbles. it is slightly eerie. it has the
queer feeling of things not created in this world, things that are not quite
right to our perception, like the paint cans i put in there. 

i want the hallway to be shaped like a knot

i keep getting this image of a room drenched in red light. not sure why an art
house would be lit in red. 

another cool idea is if instead of a hallway, it's a series of rooms. and each
room is roughly the same, layout wise. but inside each of them is a battle or
two, then the notes and drawings and such give you a clue for how to get to the
next area. i think that sounds way more fun. 
** 01/15/2021: 
the first vignette needs to have more battles. it needs to have like 8
to 10. the first two are three are training wheels. setting up the rooms like
this with one opponent per room is a little too slow. there could be two per
room. like chickenshit larry, hiding in a closet, except a little
different. crouching under the teacher's desk. there are three identical art
rooms, the first one has one, the second has two, the third has two (one of
which is larry), that's four battles. that's good training wheels. what's the
final little section of this mini dungeon? oh, that's cool: what if you go like
this

entrance -> room 1 -> room 2 -> room 3 -> room 2 (modified) -> room 1 (modified)
-> entrance (modified). and then return from whence you came through the
painting. 

each room becomes a little more...hellish? more like a dungeon? maybe the souls
in each room are the same people, with no memory of the last room where you just
vanquished them? maybe there is a story that runs through different timelines in
each of the rooms. the notes on the teacher's desk are about boon. but how are
the rooms visually different? just a rearranging of the tables and chairs? that
doesn't sound very satisfying. 

maybe in the last room they go in the closet and walk downstairs to find a
gallery. thinking of the factory in CSH, where it's this open thing but
separated by walls to where it doesn't feel like you're just walking through a
hallway. you're in this dank gallery of forgotten paintings, unused paints and
oils and canvases from a hundred years ago, dead rats. you maneuver around it
and you find the painting of the knot and as you're about to touch it this
baddie swoops in.

there's two parts to this that i'm missing. the first: the actual barb part of
the subplot. but this is mostly going to be the conversations that happen
between each room. so i'm ok with not writing the exact dialogue, because this
is a storyboard, i just want the thrust of what they say. and the second is the
tone of this. i feel like this is actually set out fairly well. warbling,
twisted, dark, unreal. i guess the problem really is that when i got to charles
(who is a great first henchman kind of guy), the tone kind of inadvertently
changed into something goofy and very video gamey. not necessarily something
that i want to avoid, though. this IS a video game. don't pretend that it's not,
and don't get caught up too much in your own ass about the Feel and Tone of the
game precisely. charles should be a little goofy. charles is huge and a little
slow and lets secrets slip without thinking about it. and he has a huge evil
belly laugh: BWA HA HA HA !!! (that's in italics, by the way) 

why do souls do what they do? are they alive -- what is the difference between
them, mentally and emotionally, and someone who is alive? perhaps fate is the
difference: human beings get pulled and torn in opposing directions by fate, but
at the end of the day they retain the agency to if not defeat it at least _fight
back against it_. but these souls are hollow. they may look and act and feel
like humans when you are in this world, but they are puppets of fate. the more
you inspect them, the more you realize they are like intricate toy wind-up
dolls, following some preset pattern of steps and hi's and ho's but without any
of the decision that makes it meaningful. when souls come to you with their
problems, you offer solution. but it is as if they do not hear you, as if they
cannot hear you. the souls that surround boon being a little different, as if
infused by his essence. and the librarian being a notable exception as a
who-knows-the-fuck-what-but-definitely-not-dead. 
** 01/16/2021: [story] big picture
getting a late start...it's about one in the morning. but it must be done every
day. 

current state of ideas for the big plot:
all events that ever were, are, or will be are woven into a fabric. the fabric's
pattern is finely wrought, complex beyond belief, but it is still ultimately a
pattern. the problem with disrupting a pattern is not the site of incident, it's
everything that ever comes after it. and a thread has come loose in the
fabric. time and causality are losing their integration. the disruption of the
pattern centers around the main character, not for any particular reason but
simply because things must happen to someone. he was intended to die a young,
pointless death. but something broke, and he lived, and this is causing the
universe to unravel. it tries to self-repair, to bring things to a steady and
acceptable state, which naturally means that it tries to kill him. and it
half-succeeds, but his soul cannot pass through to the realm of the
dead. instead, it is stuck in limbo. he does not know this, though, and believes
himself to be in a fight for his life. he travels through the version of his
school in limbo, until he finds and defeats the spirits which did this to him
and is faced with a choice: his life, or the self consistency of the universe as
we know it.

his foes are two corrupted spirits, byproducts of the death of causality, that
have infected the boys in the physical world who kicked the shit out of
him. they are not anthropomorphic spirits, like the rest of the cast. boon will
come to find upon the final confrontation that they are manifestations of
predestination. they cannot be spoken to, reasoned with, or overcome through
force. through his journey, boon will believe them to be more or less regular
souls, like the ones who populate the world. he will seek their motives, their
whereabouts, their weaknesses. and he will find and defeat many souls: grunts,
henchman, officers, the men women and children that have been lined up like
dominos by these unseen forces to act out this elaborate play. but they are
simple marionettes. 

theme: fate does not choose you, it's just that things have to happen to
someone. 

random idea: what about one of the first two halls being about you tracking down
some sage, or some friend of the librarian's, or someone along those lines who
has been held hostage?

ah feck. i'm having trouble figuring out the causality here. so fate starts to
unravel around boon...does that cause him to have a near death experience? or
was he ordained to die, and the universe is trying to self-repair the pattern to
make sure that happens? or was he ordained to live, and the unraveling is
causing him to die? or is the universe merely fighting him off like an antibody
would a virus?

1 is just kind of random and doesn't push the plot or ideas. like, yea, it gives
you a reason to be down there: something shitty just happened to you. and even
though that is in line with the themes i have, it's not compelling. i'm sure
there's an entry for it on tv tropes, and i don't know what it's called, but
it's basically: insert a fancy sounding but utterly meaningless cause for the
events which are about to transpire.

2 is cool because at the end of the game you can say: boon, you have to die, or
else the whole world will unravel. but it's also weird, because: who knows this
information? i guess the librarian could. that would be pretty sweet. 

---

ok so there's your big picture plot. so boon will gradually learn that the
universe is unravelling, and that maybe he could have some part in fixing it --
but not what fixing it entails for him. so then what you need is still the peaks
of the plot. of course the first peak is the arrival in limbo. the last peak is
the confrontation with the false villains. you need two peaks in between
there. one for each hall. 

...what if this isn't a school themed game? that's kind of a terrifying thought
LOL i mean not much of the game is _dependent_ on it taking place in a
school. the art room stuff would be kind of weird but really it's just a
backdrop rather than an integral part. i am just unsure what else the backdrop
would be. somewhere vaguely dank/dungeon-y? like an underground civilization?
** 01/17/2021: [code] first look
what code do i need to make part one happen? and how detailed does it have to
be? because if it was "as detailed as the final product minus assets", that
would be a ton of work. because you would have to iron out the battle system,
the mechanics, moves, start designing creatures and enemies and dungeon layout
and placement and all sorts of things. 

here's a thought / decision. max told me earlier today: stick to your
vision. you know what you want to make, so make it. well, playing CSH has been
fun and i really like how each battle is kind of its own puzzle. but i want this
game to be more than that: i want it to be a dungeon crawler. so there is the
game itself of the individual battles, but there is also managing your resources
through this long dungeon and figuring out how to preserve your health

the problem with the battles is that it's pretty much all or nothing, right?
either you have meaningful battles and you have to iron out all the things that
make it meaningful, or you have totally pointless battles. there's no real
halfway. i mean, maybe you don't need to have everything ironed out. somewhere
in this file i have a lot of notes on what the battle system itself looks
like. the basics of it. designing the battle system is different than balancing
the dungeons, and what enemies go in them, and how you progress through
them. but even if the system is set up, you have to have the creatures to have
real battles. and if you want creatures then you're starting to design
everything. i don't think i want to do that. 

work:
- a fade-in / depixelate shader (for waking up)
- visual or auditory effect (for poking and prodding)
- dialogue
  - dialogue boxes
  - chat heads
  - dialogue options / trees
  - italics?
  - letter noises
- some kind of cutscene / battle hybrid (for the intro battle)
- ability to swap between levels / rooms
- basic dialogue cutscene with a trigger (for random chats)
- interactable items / NPCs (for the cafeteria)
- quest state (for larry)
- warp / contract shader (for teleporting)
- basic mock of battles
  - how they are triggered
  - how data is stored for them
  - battle loop

i need to have cutscenes. so just these little scenes where there is no player
control, but there is dialogue, and people can maybe walk around. 
** 01/18/2021
gonna skip making the intro intro aka the part in the physical world. gonna
start coding from when you wake up in the closet. shader can wait. so i need to
make a really simple cutscene. compose a few simple actions.
- entities need to start in a given location (generalized to start in a given
  state?)
- then define actions (move this entity here, display this dialogue tree, wait
  for this amount of time, play this sound)
- then a condition for the cutscene to end
- some subsystem that manages cutscenes, knows when they are happening, knows to
  steal and relinquish inputs, etc.
- some code path that i can take to begin a cutscene (probably this lives 100%
  in lua -- you're just dealing with entities and data, which both live in lua)
- easy way from the editor to start/restart/debug
  - for simple cutscenes like the beginning, it may be sufficient to just load
    up the level from a clean file and run the cut scene
  - pretty quickly tho you're going to run into cases where cutscene behaves
    differently depending on game state (simple example: you talked to X, so you
    get a different dialogue tree). for that, you might want to have basically
    save states. 

quality of life stuff:
- list out all commands baked into the console
* plot
** intro
*** an introduction!
 Open up in an everyday elementary school. Rows of particle board desks, wide
 rectangular fluorescent lights, concrete painted white on all four sides. The
 kids are all sitting, faces down intently at their exams. They can't be more
 than ten or eleven years old. One boy nervously chews a pencil while he tries to
 work out how to add fractions for the hundredth time. All is as it should be.

 Except there is pre-pubescent trouble brewing. D. Boon, glasses thick as
 coasters, rail thin, slightly hunched shoulders, sits at his desk trying
 desperately to pretend that he hasn't finished his exam. He traces his pencil
 around the same section of the page, writing, erasing, leaned over in feigned
 concentration. But he's not doing a very good job of it, because he feels
 something damp stick against his shoulder. The dreaded spitball. It would seem
 like someone else is finished with their test too -- finished, or doesn't care.

 "Lemme see your /answers/, Boon." It's O'Doyle. He's big for his age, already a
 solid five nine, and fat to boot. His face shows the promise of acne, his
 jawline the promise of coming in -- puberty is soon to come to him. But for now,
 his malice is merely that of a childhood bully. Nothing so insidious as the
 social schemes of high school. 

 O'Doyle is a regular thorn in Boon's side. He's smart enough to know how to push
 Boon's buttons -- not just some brainless mudslinger. And more importantly, he's
 physically imposing. He's always saying some shit to him, not just isolated
 incidents of violence. 

 "..." 

 Boon stares ahead intently, focused /hard/ on not reacting. He wants to get the
 teacher's attention, but she's slumped back in her chair, dozed off reading a
 novel with a well-oiled Scottish man on the cover.

 /Just don't say anything and he'll go away/

 "Come on Boon, if I don't pass the fifth grade my dad'll /beat/ me." He delivers
 it with the quality of a joke he knows is too black for someone his age.

 A soft poke comes from from Boon's other side. "Yeah, Boon, I need the answers
 too. Heh heh." Tweedle-dee and Tweedle-dum, O'Doyle and Levi. Dynamic duos for all
 time. Levi is a /lot/ dumber than O'Doyle, but also morbidly larger and
 decidedly meaner.

 POKE. The first one just got his attention, but the second one breaks
 skin. "STOP," Boon can't help but cry out in pain and frustration. The teacher
 snaps awake. 

 "WHAT is going ON? You're supposed to be taking a test!"

 Boon doesn't say anything -- he knows she won't punish him, but he doesn't want
 to deal with the two of them. He puts his head down and shrugs
 half-heartedly. O'Doyle and Levi find a sudden interest on the cement blocks on
 the other side of the room. Mrs. Miller sees their guilt and says, "Let me speak
 to the three of you. After class."

 --- 3 PM

 A bell tolls as the scene is black. It's a school bell, but it's slightly
 dissonant.

 Cut out, cut back in. Mrs. Miller is finishing up some lesson, but the bell cuts
 her off before she has a chance to finish. Boon tries to slip out quickly, but
 she catches him. She sits the three of them down in the front row and starts
 asking questions. The story comes out -- she takes Boon's side, of course, as
 the sweet, bright boy. She asks to see Boon's side, and when she sees a prick of
 crusted over blood, she becomes serious. 

 "This is worse than I thought. You realize what this means, right? This means
 you committed a /violent act/. I have no choice but to suspend you both for a
 week."

 "A week?!", O'Doyle cries out. "But my dad's going to kill me! Please,
 Mrs. Miller, I'll do anything, I'll even apologize to Boon here. Watch: Boon,
 I'm sorry." 

 "I'm sorry, Richard, but there's nothing I can do. It's county policy. Now you
 kids go before the buses leave."

 --- Outside the classroom

 Boon hangs back for just a minute, tying his shoe more slowly than he ever has
 before. He finally leaves, starts down the hallway, and almost makes it to the
 bus parking lot. But he gets stopped -- by who else? And they're mad, this
 time. 

 "I'm done screwing around. I'm gonna show you what happens when you screw with
 someone you shouldn't!"

 Levi sneers at him and pushes him in the locker. O'Doyle throws a sucker punch
 as Boon cowers back into the wall of lockers. Levi picks him up and disables
 him by putting him in a bear hug. They walk the way they came from, past a few
 classrooms, and stop before a janitor's closet.  

 "It's Friday. Let's see how you like being suspended this weekend."

 With that, he throws Boon into the closet. His vision is starting to fade. On
 the ground, he sees Levi walk up and loom over him. He didn't realize how big he
 was. He wonders if his dad is disappointed that he's not bigger. He wonders
 what's for dinner. How's he going to turn his homework in tomorrow? Wait, isn't
 tomorrow Saturday? Or is it Tuesday? He barely has time to realize that he's
 blacking out when Levi rears his heavy, booted foot back and and gives him

 One.

 Last.

 KICK.

 "Don't mess with me."

*** an indeterminate amount of time later
 when boon comes to, he's in a room that looks exactly like the janitor's closet
 that he blacked out in, but twisted. it's slightly degraded, it looks wrong, the
 music is droning and warbling. 

 there is  a young boy standing over him, prodding him and cooling his
 face with a damp rag. the boy looks to be younger than boon, about ten years
 old. he's dressed in an old time schoolboy's uniform -- jacket, necktie, tucked
 into shorts with a pair of black oxfords and long socks. he still has a child's
 chubbiness and red cheeks, and he speaks formally like someone of old money. he
 introduces himself as oliver. 

 he doesn't seem surprised to see you. you ask him where you are, and he replies
 that you are in limbo. souls who cannot pass into the afterlife live on this
 plane. in particular, souls who still have an unresolved connection to the
 school are trapped in this place, which is the mirrored version of the school in
 this realm. new such souls come through here pretty often, and this is the place
 where they land. it's kind of his job to man the station and usher through any
 new souls that come here.

 "does this mean that i'm dead," you ask. normally yes, he says, but something is
 different about you. your soul still has a physical component. even though the
 souls here have not fully moved to the spiritual realm, they are still fully
 composed of spirit. 

 next logical question: can i get back? oliver pauses. he's not entirely sure --
 he has never seen anyone like you come through here. but then again, there are a
 lot of weird things going on right now. maybe we should go talk to the
 librarian. he'll know what to do.
*** talking to the librarian
 you walk out of the janitor's closet into the lobby of a school. the lobby of
 your school, in fact. but just like the closet, something is off about
 it. moreover, it has a slight resemblance to a shanty town -- a place that's
 been co-opted for something beyond its original purpose. it's not like a favela,
 but it definitely has a thrown together vibe to it. you can tell that the, shall
 we say high class souls are not who resides here. 

 from the lobby, you can get to a couple places. the cafeteria has been co-opted
 into the town square. there are shops here, there are spots of congregation (do
 souls need to eat...?). there are a few rooms for the teachers that don't belong
 in any particular grade -- art, music. the principal's office is there, and it
 looks extremely ominous, like how a ten year old imagines the principal's
 office. there's also a secretary's office, and the vice principal's office is
 attached to it. 

 but you're headed to the library. the library isn't small per se, but it's kept
 more like the personal library of a wealthy man than an elementary school
 library. it's cozy, and (just like its keeper) it's refined. as you enter, the
 librarian is attending carefully to the goings of his library. he has his
 glasses pushed down to his nose, carefully reading the label on a book from a
 stack of unsorted books on a cart. he looks up as you come in.

 "well hello, oliver. did you bring us another new one?" he is neither an old man
 nor a young man, but he gives off an air of...more than wisdom or
 learnedness. when he says this to you, it seems as if he already has complete
 knowledge of the situation and what's going down. 

 "yes, sir. his name's boon. but, um, sir, he seems to still be..._alive_..."

 "alive, is that right? oliver, could you fetch my other pair of glasses from my
 desk?"

 "yes, sir!" oliver scampers quickly to his desk and returns with the
 glasses. the librarian puts them on and takes a few steps toward boon. 

 "open your mouth and say 'ahhhhh'," the librarian says. boon does so, and the
 librarian replies, "well i'll be had! you're right oliver, this young man is
 suffering from an acute case of hypervivitosis. in other words -- he's alive!"

 "well, lad, what are you doing here?" he asks boon

 boon looks down, quiet, and tells the librarian the story all the way up to him
 waking up and seeing oliver over him. "i didn't mean to tattle on them. i don't
 understand why they hurt me so bad. and now...i think i'm dying."

 the librarian takes a thoughtful step back. his voice grows more serious. "you
 were right to bring him here, oliver. things are not right in our realm. those
 two souls have warped the fabric of the two realities."

 he goes on to explain: two souls recently manifested here -- the souls of the
 two boys who beat you. but, like you, something was wrong with them. they were
 still, in part, alive. they quickly became powerful, and they've taken control
 of most of this realm. in fact, only the hub remains. and now that you have
 arrived, it seems that fate itself is pulling you together.

 "boon, do you know how to battle?" the librarian asks

 "i...i'm ten..." boon replies

 "right, and quick as a whip you are." the librarian goes onto explain: souls
 fracture when they come to this realm. more fractured ones are not as human as
 the ones you see, but are powerful in the way a feral animal is powerful. some
 may harness them and use them to battle. i have such a fragment here -- go ahead
 and try it. and you learn to battle, et. cetera. 

 after you've learned the battle mechanics, the librarian says, "hm, i'm not
 surprised that you're one of the ones who can control fractured souls. mother
 fate has special plans for you, boon."

 "i can't say what you need to do, son. i doubt you can return to your old life,
 but it is possible that you could return to your realm. figuring out how to get
 into the sixth grade hall isn't a bad place to start -- i'm sure if you find out
 what's going on there, you'll have some clue to getting back to your realm." the
 librarian says.

 "but i don't know anybody here. how will i figure out how to get there?"

 "i have a feeling that what is meant to be will find its way to you. why don't
 you investigate? go talk to some people. i'm sure you will find something," he
 finishes with almost a smile and a wink about him. 

 he gives you a brief rundown of the places in the hub. 

 "alright? try not to worry yourself too much, son. these things have a way of
 working themselves out." the librarian says

 "..."

 "..."

 (i'm not sure what boon says here. something kind of whimpering)
** interlude 1: barbara ann
*** finding the portal
 boon and oliver step outside the library. they take a few steps, and oliver
 stops. 

 "you know, i'm like that soul you have"

 "what?" boon asks

 "feral. i'm not fractured like they are, but i once was. it's been so long i can
 barely remember it, but i was, and i never fully healed. you can battle with me,
 boon. i don't know why, but it feels like the right thing to do."

 "okay, oliver. i don't understand this world. but if you think it's the right
 thing to do, then i'll do it."

 "i do. look, i don't know how we're going to get to the sixth grade hall, but
 something in me tells me we have to try! why don't we go talk to people in the
 cafeteria?"

 boon and oliver take the short walk over to the cafeteria. the cafeteria is a
 large room -- it's the hub of the hub, and it's really more like a town square
 than a room unto itself. it's laid out kind of like downtown mountain view. in
 the middle are a few lanes of long cafeteria tables and chairs, with different
 souls idling at them. the sides are lined with different kinds of shops -- the
 equivalent of the armory, the apothecary, places of hangout, houses. 

 the air is tense, slightly abuzz, with the air of an event that is not
 completely known. there are a few main clumps of people sitting at the tables. 

 the pair walk up to one of the clumps. there are a lot of people, and depending
 on who you talk to, you get a slightly different answer. the conversations are
 not long form here, but they are certainly not one liners. there are pieces of
 lore, pieces of humanity in all of these conversations. souls telling you how
 they died, souls bitching about their day to day problems, gossiping about the
 hall blockages. one soul tells you not to talk about getting into the halls too
 loudly. some people haven't heard anything about getting into sixth grade hall,
 one person mentions that it's a shame about that girl barbara, another says that
 it seems kind of fishy. 

 ultimately, boon and oliver take the hint.
*** the art room
 boon and oliver walk into the art room. it's tucked off in a far corner of the
 hub, and when you walk in it is clear that it has not been occupied in a long
 time. the lights have a low, ominous hum, and they occasionally flicker. there
 are easels and paint supplies lying around. the teacher's desk is in the front
 left corner, and is scattered with papers. there are two rows of three long
 desks, for students to work on, that are covered in half finished drawings. 

 "something doesn't feel right in here, sir!"

 "i'm not even dead and i can feel it," says boon. "and why is this place still
 an art class? the cafeteria here didn't look like the cafeteria in my world."

 "it's hard for me to remember, but things are different here...some things can
 change very quickly in this realm, but some things kind of, uhm, _push back_
 against change..." oliver replies

 "well, this place isn't very big. i can't see where this girl would be
 hiding. and besides, we don't even know if she's who we're looking for. maybe we
 should go back to the cafeteria?"

 "i have a funny feeling about this place! when i was alive, my daddy would tell
 me: if you want to have an adventure, keep your eyes open and be patient. well,
 let's keep our eyes open."

 "okay. well, let's look around then."

 they look around a bit. inspecting the teacher's desk shows the teacher's
 personal diary. they are dissatisfied with life. their students don't care,
 their parents don't care, they want to dedicate themselves to something real but
 the whole world just feels like bullshit @polish. there are childish and
 innocent drawings scattered around the desks. but overall, nothing sticks out as
 overly strange.

 on the back wall, there is a large painting. it's a knot, worked in a finely
 detailed but impressionistic oil painting. the knot is loose, and it looks like
 there is a thread on the knot that would unravel the whole thing if you gave it
 a gentle tug. 

 boon looks at the painting and says to himself, "oh? what's this?"
 he reaches his hand out, half in a trance, and goes as if to pull on the
 knot. "it's almost as if you could undo it..."

 as he moves his hand down, the room begins to fuzz out. oliver asks him a
 question in passing, but he can't hear it over the growing thrumming and pulsing
 of the room. it pulses in and out like it has a beating heart of its own.

 "...boon....wh....you.....ing?" oliver is almost completely inaudible now

 boon's hand comes all the way down on the painting. the world warps and turns
 and contracts to a point. boon hears oliver yelling. but it's too late, and as
 quickly as it expanded it contracts back to normal size.

*** come take my hand
when boon and oliver get their bearings, they realize that they are not in the
room they were just in. they are in a closet of old, forgotten paintings. chief
and largest among them is the painting that drew boon in -- but instead of a
loosely knotted piece of rope, it is cinched completely tight. the room is
small, dark, and dusty -- it is clearly a storage closet of sorts, not a
gallery.

"are you alright, sir?"

"wh..where are we? and stop calling me sir! i don't even know how i got us here,
and i'm barely ten years old!"

"sorry, s--sorry."

as they chat, they hear a knock on the door.

"hey! hey! i can hear you in there! come out, i've been stuck here forever,
please help me! i think your door is locked from the inside" a young, feminine
voice calls from outside.

"do you think that could be barbara?" oliver asks

"it sounds like a girl...but what if it's a trap? we don't even know where we
are right now! we should stay put until...someone comes to find us. or until
we're ready to go out."

"i think we're right jammed in this one, boon," oliver says nervously. "a prep
school boy should be self sufficient," he says, panic rising and convincing
himself, "and extricate (/huff/) himself from all manner (huff) of ungainly
(GAAAAAAASP)"

"oliver? are you okay?"

"oh yes, sir, yes (huff) sir. just a bit of the old asthma." oliver says, taking
a deep breath.

BANG, BANG, BANG. "what are you DOING in there? get out here and help me!"

"okay, okay. here goes..." says boon.

they walk out to find themselves in a room that is like a darker, twisted
version of the art room they just came from. the paintings strewn through the
room are surreal and slightly horrific -- ultra realistic oil paintings of a
goat and a dog successfully sewn together at the abdomen, men in dark black
robes melting their fingers like candlewax over tins of burning sage, sinister
cities of fractals expanding in burnt orange in black. the black work desks are
now covered in occult symbols and frantic writing. but it is not satanic and
horrifying so much as it is _wrong_. the paint cups have names like "the
rainslick summer dreams of our dead forefathers", and "two forks gently making
love in the moonlight", and "the lord our god laying his tendrils unto
us". something does not make sense about this space. the papers on the teacher's
desk now reads like an entry from bots of new york e.g.

"My wife can make an omelette just like a king. You’re right. She’s a little
scary. She likes to get a little scary. But not a little scary. A little scary
but not a little scary. A little scary but not a little scary. A little like
this: a homeless man sleeps on the curb. A drug lord guards the grave. And a
little scary-- an arsonist sits on the bench. Now put the lunchbox away, because
I’m gonna be the first to tell you—it doesn’t matter how much you pound this
shit. If my wife says it matters, you’ll fucking live for three minutes."

and right by the door, there is a young woman. she looks to be about sixteen,
and looks like she was a cheerleader in her past life: short, with a thin but
muscular frame, blonde hair, washed out blue eyes, and a semipermanent pout on
her face. she looks up and down the pair, and a look of horror creeps across her
face.

"oh, jesus christ! i've been stuck here for god knows how long and they send two
_ten year olds_ to come get me?! have you guys even hit _puberty_ yet?"

boon and oliver look at each other, surprised, and don't know what to say to
this.

"well? they sent you, right? my boyfriend johnny and my friends? are you going
to save me or what?"

"uhm, actually ma'am, nobody sent us. we were hoping to get into the sixth
grade, and we heard you used to go there a lot. but nobody could find you...so
we went to look in the art room." oliver says

"and you got sucked into here, right?" she asks. "by the picture of the rope?"

boon nods vigorously, glad that he hasn't gone insane, and says, "right! the
picture of the half knot!"

"well, yes, we're not sure how it happened, but here we are," oliver replies

she pauses for a second, building a slow glare. she's still paused. the silence
hangs until it's almost uncomfortable, and then she says

"HERE YOU ARE?? i can't believe you idiots got stuck looking for me and now i
have to take care of you" barb says

"i'm sorry ma'am, but if i could be so bold as to say that boon and i have some
experience battling. we should be more than capable of taking care of
ourselves!" oliver says

"trading card battles don't count. how the hell am i supposed to get past all
those thugs outside when i have to babysit at the same time?" barb replies

"uhm, did you say _thugs_?" boon asks

"i know you said you didn't come to rescue me, but are you really that stupid?
everyone has heard about those thugs that took over the three grade halls. well,
wherever we are, they're here, too."

"i told you we should wait for someone to come find us, oliver!", boon says

"er, pardon me, ma'am, but...where _are_ we?" oliver asks

"well, if i knew, i wouldn't be here to explain it to you, now would i?" barb
snaps back

"i suppose so," oliver says, prompting a glare from barb.

"we have to be somewhere in the school, because otherwise all those guards
wouldn't be here. but i've never even heard of a place like this. everything
feels so _wrong_ here. and that thing with the painting...this is so stupid!"

"are you sure there isn't any way we can wait for someone to come find us?" boon
asks 

"what's wrong with you? why do you want to sit here like a log so bad? i've been
here forever and no one else has come around yet. it's like my dad always told
me: if you have a problem, go solve it. i just hope you don't slow me down
getting out of here."

"uhm, ma'am, have you considered the possibility of escaping by _stealth_?"
oliver asks

"of course i have! how stupid do you think i am? but there's nowhere to hide. i
looked around a little bit already. besides, what do you think this is, metal
gear solid?"

the three finish making plans and set out.
*** rockin' and a-rollin'
they walk out the door and enter...a room that looks precisely like the one they
were just in. they question among themselves: did we just walk through a
non-euclidean door? but no, there was no entrance door into the last room. it's
just like this. they walk out of the little entryway and are discovered by a
guard. once he's dispatched, boon is pretty shaky. oliver consoles him by
telling him that it's not like he _killed_ the guard or anything, and that what
happens to defeated souls is a bit, erm, metaphysically difficult. barb
complains that she broke a nail.

they try the door, but they feel that it's locked. barb notices that the rooms
are subtly different, having been stuck in hers for weeks. they look around,
they find the clues, and they open the door.

@quest(chickenshit larry)
the second room is very similar. the third room as well, though in that room
there is a guard hiding in the broom closet. if you open it, he yells in
terror. you can talk to him -- he's stuck here, and he can't say where here is
exactly, but the place feels so wrong and he's _heard_ what the boss told him
about souls who get killed twice and he's so chickenshit terrified and -- and
you can choose to fight him or let him go (but you get experience both ways).

either way, chickenshit larry tells you: these rooms go on forever. the way to
get back is via the supply closets. they all have a special switch you can pull
that open you back up to the portal room. he shows you the switch, whether you
dispatch him or not. 

the switch opens up a set of stairs. you walk down, and come to a large room
that looks almost like a larger version of the storage closet you were
in. except, instead of containing just a few put-away supplies, this looks like
it has everything that ever passed unused through this art room. there are dusty
canvases, paints and oils from the early ninteen hundreds, tarps over what
appear to be huge scupltures, stacks and stacks of old paint cans. the room
feels open, but is ultimately a long rectangle with a path through loosely
defined by the gaps between the shit. there are three more battles here. 

at the far end of the warehouse, the trio spots it: the knot painting. a third
loop has been added to it, and it is cinched completely tight. 

"well, i guess that's our way out..." boon says

they walk over to the painting. but as they approach it, someone drops down as
if from the rafters. he is a huge man, with skinny legs and a giant barrel of a
torso. he wears a workman's clothes: overall styled dungarees, suspenders, white
t-shirt, boots. he has a scraggly, thick mustache that peeks over his upper lip,
and his head is shaved. his face is hard and worn. when he speaks, he booms over
everyone and everything. his name is Charles van der Meulen, dutch immigrant
from the thirties, took up a job working construction on 'scrapers but met an
untimely death at the hands of a loose crane boom and several hundred feet of
air time. @polish(could his name symbolise something? the ties that have begun
to bind them)

"i knew i'd catch you little fuckers here!"

"we're just trying to get back to our realm, sir!", oliver says

"right, which is how you ended up in this little honeypot we set up. the only
way you could have ended up here is by using the fake portal to sixth grade that
we put up over the real one", charles says

the group shares a look. 

"i guess you're not going to let us go, then?" boon asks

"HELL NO! I'M GONNA HAMMER JACK YOU LITTLE BUGS INTO THE GROUND!! BWA HA HA HA
HA !!!"

so you battle, and the trio wins (of course). and after you battle, you get one
of those scenes where the newly-vanquished villain speaks to you to advance the
plot forward a bit before he keels over for good. and charles swears up and down
that he won't open his lips about a single thing, 
** dungeon 1: sixth grade
*** in knowledge, there is power
** old notes
Boon wakes up. He's in a place that looks like 

all of this twisted world is a school -- of course it is. dungeons are made of
wings of the school. limbo, then the lower classmen, and then finally: the eigth
graders. the big shits. each dungeon is made of rooms of the school. classrooms
where students and damned teachers reside. the janitor's closet, which might
have an enemy like a huge lice. the nurse's office. 

you must make it to the principal's office at the end of eighth grade hall to
battle the final boss


LIMBO. 
it's a place where the souls of fifth graders are trapped when they
can't ascend to middle school. some of them got held back -- their minds and
souls couldn't recover socially from being a sixth grader in fifth grade. some
of them moved away and could never adjust to their new lives, clinging to the
brief happy days at the end of their childhood. some of them died. but for
whatever reason, their souls remain here at the bridge between fifth grade and
sixth grade. 

what kind of places would be in limbo? well, all kinds of places. it's places
that people could not move on from, for some reason. their favorite teacher's
class room. the basketball court where they had to feel so physically
inadequate. it's the turnaround where they had to wait for their abusive father
to arrive, drunk, to take them home. it's where they took the math test that
made them feel permanently stupid. it's the lunch room where they felt socially
isolated for months on end. 

everything is a little bit backwards in limbo. the music is geogaddi, off center
dissonance that warbles around a specific note. rewound tape loops. maybe the
rest of the game has some goofy darkness, but i don't know about this place. i
guess now is a good time to think of the tone of the game more. on one hand, i
like the idea of something dark and lonesome and low and a bit unsettling, blues
and earthy algae spaceship faux organic greens, warbling synthesizers, sinister,
lost. like a neil gaiman comic. but i also love how absurd it sounds to battle old
headmasters and science teachers and jocks like they're animals. they lose some
human part of themselves which makes them hold back, but they retain enough to
be recognizable as human. the fact that they are taking it as a serious eternal
struggle when they're really just locked in a meaningless fight commanded by a
fifth grader is grimly hilarious. also like a neil gaiman comic. i don't want to
lose that for the sake of being Grim Dark. 

i think one of the best things undertale did was have dialogue scenes. you don't
have to be able to say anything meaningful (altho in undertale you could). just
the fact that they are talking to you, doing more than just walking over and
battling, that's awesome. 

i do want this game to be funny. simple and funny. 

who's your sidekick? definitely some former person at the school. what about a
fourth grader. one who was killed at the school in some violent (but ultimately
accidental) way. he's very meek, timid, and proper. he wants to avoid offending,
but he's also been around for a /long/ time, so he's actually quite savvy as to
how things work down here. 

something isn't right here. it's twisted, inverted. things have a set way of
working here, and it's becoming /wrong/. turns out, that thing is levi and
o'doyle becoming the kings of hell. they're the final boss.

you have some sidekick who cheerfully tells you about the world you
inhabit. maybe they could even be your starter? 

creatures are the souls of everyday things. simple things, maybe even things
that aren't jazzed up at all. like, a dog that is just a dog. a chair. slightly
anthropomorphic, maybe. 

if that's the case, how do you differentiate creatures? you can't have lamp learn
fire blast but not ice beam -- how do you reconcile that? could i pare down some
of the types i have? actually, ditching types might not be a bad idea. or make
the type system another RPS. that way you have two simple RPS stacked on top of
each other. either way, struggling with the idea of how to give meaningful,
simple competitive flavor when the creatures are literally things like a fucking
table and a chair. 

ordinary things: table, chair, basketball, jacket, pencil

OOH

what if instead of the creatures being ordinary things, they are the spirits of
people who were left behind 

and the fact that multiple people can control them is because their soul splits
and shards -- it's not whole, so it can't be conscious, but each part of it
contains enough of them to be selfsame.

let's make the type RPS visually simple. what about jocks > nerds > teachers? or
something more complicated: the damned (souls that are tragically trapped at the
school), the unborn (souls that never matured enough to leave the school), the
normals (souls attached to a real, active student in the material world). but
that doesn't quite make sense -- normal souls aren't going to be creatures
here. will they? it would be pretty fucking funny if you could catch and train
dylan driver. 

the damned are good at attacking. they are angry and resentful, and they want to
hurt you as they have been hurt.

the unborn are good at grabbing. they are immature. they could never stand on
two solid feet and make it in life. they're just grabbing at whatever they can. 
 
the normals are good at defending. they don't want to be pulled into the world
of souls -- they enjoy living. so they are built to do that.
